# 2 - Security Operations

## Assets

▪ One of the main tasks of risk professionals is providing secure systems to protect the main assets of the organization&#x20;

▪ An asset is anything that can be used to produce value for your organization.”&#x20;

▪ What we are trying to protect - people, property and information.&#x20;

– It must have value to you, your oorganization or a country, otherwise there is no need to protect it.

### Examples of Assets

▪ Data (customer data, databases, patents, marketing information on clients)&#x20;

▪ Physical assets (devices, machines, servers, hardware, software)&#x20;

▪ Processes (especially in OT situations) OT = Operational Technology

▪ People / Personnel&#x20;

▪ Reputation, goodwill

### Tangible and Intangible assets

**Tangible assets** - are physical; they include cash, inventory, vehicles, equipment, buildings or investment

**Intangible assets** - do not exist in physical form and include things like IP addresses, data, etc.

### Asset Criticality

▪ Nobody has unlimited resources, therefore there is a need to prioritize security efforts according to the asset’s criticality to the business&#x20;

▪ Assessing risks should focus on those assets deemed to be most critical&#x20;

▪ Criticality is typically defined as a measure of the consequences associated with the loss or degradation of a particular asset&#x20;

▪ In other words, what is there to lose?
