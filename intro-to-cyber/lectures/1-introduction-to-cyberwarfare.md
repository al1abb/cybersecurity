# 1 -  Introduction to Cyberwarfare

## Introduction to cyber security and cyber warfare

### What is Cybersecurity?

• One main purpose: To identify cyber threats in an organization, calculate the risk related to those threats, and handle those threats accordingly.&#x20;

• Every type of organization such as medical, financial, or education institutions, uses a network to operate effectively.&#x20;

• Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect these networked systems and their data from unauthorized use or harm.

• Cyber Security is the process and techniques involved in protecting sensitive data, computer systems, networks, and software applications (called assets) from cyber attacks.&#x20;

• Cyber attacks cover many different topics and situations, but some of the popular ones are:&#x20;

– Tampering systems and data stored within&#x20;

– Exploitation of resources&#x20;

– Unauthorized access to the targeted system and accessing sensitive information&#x20;

– Disrupting normal functioning of the business and its processes&#x20;

– Using ransomware attacks to encrypt data and extort money from victims

### Why is cybersecurity important?

• The world of computer systems connected to the Internet may prove dangerous for users, considering the following facts:&#x20;

– Sticking to the rules of computer security won’t bring immediate benefits or visible effect&#x20;

– Computer experts have a vastly wider knowledge of computer security than the average user (but do not always share user’s innocent goals and intentions)&#x20;

– Software developers usually concentrate on operability and user experience rather than security issues&#x20;

– There is a constant arms race between security specialists and cybercriminals

## CIA Triad Model

– **Confidentiality** is how assets and data are exposed to people or processes, and ensures that only people who are supposed to access a resource can access it!&#x20;

– **Integrity** ensures assets and data are not changed without proper authorization!&#x20;

– **Availability** ensures data or assets are accessible when needed!

## Stuxnet

• **Target**: Destroy the Iranian nuclear program&#x20;

• **Developed**: June 2009. Spreading began late 2009/early 2010. Discovered in July 2010&#x20;

• **The players**: According to the press, it was developed by the United States of America and Israel&#x20;

• **Attack vector**: Attack was based on a USB drive for initial infection, then sophisticated spread through the network&#x20;

• **Evasion**: using stolen digital certificates which made it look like genuine software to antivirus scanners&#x20;

• **Bottom line**: Delay of 2 years in the Iranian nuclear program

## Stuxnet effect

• **Duqu (2011)** - Based on Stuxnet code, Duqu was designed to log keystrokes and mine data from industrial facilities, presumably to launch a later attack.&#x20;

• **Flame (2012)** - Flame, like Stuxnet, traveled via USB stick. Flame was sophisticated spyware that recorded Skype conversations, logged keystrokes, and gathered screenshots, among other activities. It targeted government and educational organizations and some private individuals mostly in Iran and other Middle Eastern countries.&#x20;

• **Havex (2013)** - Havex intended to gather information from energy, aviation, defense, and pharmaceutical companies, among others. Havex malware targeted mainly U.S., European, and Canadian organizations.&#x20;

• **Industroyer (2016)** - This targeted power facilities. It’s credited with causing a power outage in the Ukraine in December 2016.&#x20;

• **Triton (2017)** - This targeted the safety systems of a petrochemical plant in the Middle East, raising concerns about the malware maker’s intent to cause physical injury to workers.
