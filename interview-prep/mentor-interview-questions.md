### 5) Digital Evidence Types, Order of Volatility, Chain of Custody

* **Digital Evidence Types**: Include files, logs, emails, and metadata.
* **Order of Volatility**: Refers to the order in which evidence should be collected based on its volatility (e.g., RAM is more volatile than hard drives).
* **Chain of Custody**: A record of who handled the evidence, ensuring its integrity and admissibility in court.

### 6) Threat Hunting (Low)

The proactive process of searching for potential threats and vulnerabilities within a network or system before they can cause harm, typically using advanced analytics and threat intelligence.

### 7) Incident Detection types, IOC/BIOC, Baseline, Behaviour Based Analysis

* **Incident Detection Types**: Can be signature-based, anomaly-based, or behavior-based.
* **IOC/BIOC**: Indicators of Compromise/Behavioral Indicators of Compromise are signs that a system has been compromised or is being targeted.
* **Baseline**: A baseline represents the normal operating conditions of a system to help identify deviations that may indicate an incident.
* **Behavior-Based Analysis**: Analyzes the behavior of systems and users to detect suspicious activities.

### 8) Threat Intelligence (Med)

Information about current and potential threats to an organizationâ€™s security. It helps in understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by attackers.

### 9) Cyber Kill Chain, Case Studies (Med)

**Cyber Kill Chain**: A model describing the stages of a cyber attack, including reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives.

### 10) Mitre Attack, Pyramid of Pain

* **Mitre ATT\&CK**: A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations, used for threat modeling and detection.
* **Pyramid of Pain**: A model illustrating the effectiveness of different types of indicators in defending against cyber attacks, from hashes to tactics.

### 11) Passive/Active Recon (High)

* **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gathering information without directly interacting with the target, such as through public records or social media.
* **Active Reconnaissance**: Directly interacting with the target to gather information, such as through port scans or probing.

### 12) OSINT, Dark Web (Medium)

* **OSINT**: Open Source Intelligence, information collected from publicly available sources.
* **Dark Web**: A part of the internet not indexed by traditional search engines, accessible only through specific software like Tor, often associated with illegal activities.

### 13) Social Engineering

Manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, such as phishing or pretexting.

### 14) Threat Actors

Individuals or groups that exploit vulnerabilities and conduct attacks against organizations or individuals, including hackers, insiders, and nation-state actors.

### 15) Malware Types (High)

Includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and rootkits, each with different functionalities and methods of infection.

### 16) Attack Types (High)

Can include denial-of-service attacks, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and more.

### 17) Risk, Risk impacts

* **Risk**: The potential for harm or loss resulting from a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
* **Risk Impacts**: The consequences of a risk event, such as financial loss, reputation damage, or operational disruption.
