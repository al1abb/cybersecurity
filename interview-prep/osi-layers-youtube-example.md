# OSI Layers: Youtube Example

#### Example Scenario: Watching a YouTube Video Using the OSI Model

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: You enter the URL for a video or search for it on YouTube. HTTP or HTTPS requests are made to YouTube’s servers to retrieve the video data.
2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: The video is compressed and encrypted for efficient delivery and security.
3. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: A session is established between your device and YouTube’s server to maintain your connection.
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: The video data is broken down into segments, and TCP ensures they are delivered reliably to your device.
5. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: The video data is packaged into IP packets, and routers direct the packets from YouTube’s servers to your device.
6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: The video data is placed into frames and transmitted over your local network, ensuring error-free delivery within the network.
7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: The video data is transmitted as electrical signals (if on wired) or radio waves (if on Wi-Fi) through cables or wireless networks to your device.
