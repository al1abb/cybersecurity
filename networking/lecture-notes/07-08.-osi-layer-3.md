IPv4 has 2 parts: Network and Host parts

Class A:

256 networks, 16 million hosts

Class B:

65536 nets, 65536 hosts

Class C: 16 mil nets, 256 hosts

Byte offset 6, bit 0 is R (reserved) on above image

IP Options shouldn't be used anymore. If used probably not a good thing

Without options IHL(Shows where packet header ends) = 5 (5 x 32-bit words)

With options IHL = 6. Means you should investigate

DSCP = 0, ECN = 0.&#x20;

If packet starts with 4 5 0 0 , it probably is IPv4 packet

IP packet could be up to 65536 bytes long. But you don't usually see this long of an ip addr.

Ethernet MTU is 1500 bytes

{% hint style="info" %}
Time to live default value is not set by RFC. Linux chooses 64. Windows sets it to 128

You can see from a single packet what OS is used. TTL can be seen in a simple ping
{% endhint %}

From IPv6 packet you could (initially) find out Organizational part of MAC &#x20;
