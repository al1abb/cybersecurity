Byte offset 6, bit 0 is R (reserved) on above image

IP options shouldn't be used anymore. If used probably not a good thing

Without options IHL(Shows where packet header ends) = 5

With options IHL = 6. Means you should investigate

DSCP = 0, ECN = 0.&#x20;

If packet starts with 4 5 0 0 , it probably is IPv4 packet

IP packet could be up to 65536 bytes long. But you don't usually see this long of an ip addr.

Ethernet MTU is 1500 bytes
