# 21/08. Subnetting

Subnetting was created because bigger broadcast domains cause problems: Performance, Security

Idea is to divide bigger network to a smaller networks (manageable subnetworks -> subnets)

Prefix length shows for network bits

/24 = 2^24 networks, 2^8 hosts

/16 = 2^16 networks, 2^16 hosts
