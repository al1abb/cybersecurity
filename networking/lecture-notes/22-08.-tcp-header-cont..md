# 22/08. TCP header cont.

Things like youtube and netflix still use TCP.

RST stops connection immediately

Window Size = how much data can be transferred

SYN - Syncronize.

3 way handshake - Cell phone call example

If a data loss happens, you have to continue from the last point where loss happened

You can still be connected with a window size 0 (in tcp header). Like on hold with a cell phone call

Reset is done with R flag.

Conversation can end without an R flag or a F flag if one of the devices drops from the connection
