{% hint style="info" %}
Preamble (like a header) says here comes a frame to a switch. Tells devices on the LAN that a signal is being sent

All our packet tools (Wireshark and etc.) are based on libpcap. They don't show Preamble or Footer.

Frame body max size: 1500 bytes



MAC address is unique and it is assigned to a NIC. Assigned by manufacturers.

First 3 bytes is OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier). Last 3 are assigned by vendor



Research story - Intel Pentium floating point number problem that might've caused satellites to fall. They had to replace all of these chips. Nowadays, it can be updated from software updates.



MAC address can be modified, but most people don't do it



Unicast - One to One

Broadcast - One to All (destination MAC address: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF)

Multicast - One to Group (always begins with 01-00-5E
