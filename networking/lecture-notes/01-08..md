# 01/08. OSI Layer 2

ISDN - Integrated Services Digital Network

PPP - Point to point protocol. Used with phones talking to cell towers

{% hint style="info" %}
Preamble (like a header) says here comes a frame to a switch. Tells devices on the LAN that a signal is being sent

All our packet tools (Wireshark and etc.) are based on libpcap. They don't show Preamble or Footer.
{% endhint %}

Frame body max size: 1500 bytes



MAC address is unique and it is assigned to a NIC. Assigned by manufacturers.

First 3 bytes is OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier). Last 3 are assigned by vendor



Research story - Intel Pentium floating point number problem that might've caused satellites to fall. They had to replace all of these chips. Nowadays, it can be updated from software updates.



MAC address can be modified, but most people don't do it



Unicast - One to One

Broadcast - One to All (destination MAC address: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF)

Multicast - One to Group (always begins with 01-00-5E

{% hint style="info" %}
Hub = Half-duplex (one way street)

Switch = Full-duplex (2-way road)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Wi-Fi device is like a traffic controller in wireless networks
{% endhint %}

WLAN (IEEE 802.11)

Field names are little endian

{% hint style="info" %}
The bigger the switch, the bigger the chance that it is a smart switch
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Broadcast alternative for L2 is called **Flooding**. Flooding is needed when Port number(for a MAC) is not known in CAM table.

CAM table entries age and get deleted
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
MAC Flooding Mitigation is Port security and limiting amount of MACs per port
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Users in same VLAN should not be talking to each other. Prevents Lateral Movement

Port mirroring. For intrusion detection. 2 VLANs, for 2 different ports that enable port mirroring.

1 port from the right side of the image can see all the data that flows through the red VLAN.

The port next to it, can see all the data that flows through blue VLAN.
