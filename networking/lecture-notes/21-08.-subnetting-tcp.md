# 21/08. Subnetting, TCP

## Subnetting

Subnetting was created because bigger broadcast domains cause problems: Performance, Security

Idea is to divide bigger network to a smaller networks (manageable subnetworks -> subnets)

Prefix length shows for network bits

/24 = 2^24 networks, 2^8 hosts

/16 = 2^16 networks, 2^16 hosts

## TCP

is reliable

bad guys like to hide behind port 443 (C2 Channels)

RFC says port 0 is never to be used /s :laughing:.&#x20;

But bad guys might use it (port 0) and if a developer of the firewall software has made a mistake (by not including port 0) then that will cause problems
