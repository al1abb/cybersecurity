Modem transfers analog to digital and vice versa. Can be considered a router.

Modems are router, but not all routers are modems

Mo-dem: Modulator - Demodulator



OSPF: Open Shortest Path First



There are 2 NIC types: Wired and Wireless. You can have both or one or none



Simplex example: Satellite

Halfduplex example: Walkie talkie

Full-duplex: Talking on the phone. Both sides can talk at the same time



Hub is half-duplex

Switch is full-duplex



## Copper

Unshielded Twisted Pair(UTP) cables have problems with EMI, RF. Electromagnetic Interference, Radio Frequency

Shielded TP cables are more resistent to EMI. Uses aliminium foil

Coaxial Cable: The best. Thick copper in the middle + insulation



Faraday cage. Cancels out all interference. Used in forensics. It even cancels WIFI signals



For twisted pair cables that need to go over 100m you can use repeaters, otherwise latency gets high



WiMAX might be used for mobile network towers

The AP in the class is L3 so it has arp table.

LTE is interceptable but its harder than WiFi



Microwave can interfere with WiFi signals
