# Active Directory Groups

After users, groups are another significant object in Active Directory. They can place similar users together and mass assign rights and access. Groups are another key target for attackers and penetration testers, as the rights that they confer on their members may not be readily apparent but may grant excessive (and even unintended) privileges that can be abused if not set up correctly. There are many [built-in groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#about-active-directory-groups) in Active Directory, and most organizations also create their own groups to define rights and privileges, further managing access within the domain. The number of groups in an AD environment can snowball and become unwieldy, potentially leading to unintended access if left unchecked. It is essential to understand the impact of using different group types and for any organization to periodically `audit` which groups exist within their domain, the privileges that these groups grant their members, and check for excessive group membership beyond what is required for a user to perform their day-to-day work. Moving on, we will discuss the different types of groups that exist and the scopes they can be assigned to.

One question that comes up often is the difference between Groups and Organizational Units (OUs). As discussed earlier in the module, OUs are useful for grouping users, groups, and computers to ease management and deploying Group Policy settings to specific objects in the domain. Groups are primarily used to assign permissions to access resources. OUs can also be used to delegate administrative tasks to a user, such as resetting passwords or unlocking user accounts without giving them additional admin rights that they may inherit through group membership.

## Types of Groups

In simpler terms, groups are used to place users, computers, and contact objects into management units that provide ease of administration over permissions and facilitate the assignment of resources such as printers and file share access. For example, if an admin needs to assign 50 members of a department access to a new share drive, it would be time-consuming to add each user's account individually. Granting permissions this way would also make it more difficult to audit who has access to resources and difficult to clean up/revoke permissions. Instead, a sysadmin can either use an existing group or create a new group and grant that specific group permissions over the resource. From here, every user in the group will inherit the permissions based on their membership in the group. If the permissions need to be modified or revoked for one or more users, they could merely be removed from the group, leaving the other users unaffected and their permissions intact.

Groups in Active Directory have two fundamental characteristics: `type` and `scope`. The `group type` defines the group's purpose, while the `group scope` shows how the group can be used within the domain or forest. When creating a new group, we must select a group type. There are two main types: `security` and `distribution` groups.

### **Group Type And Scope**

The `Security groups` type is primarily for ease of assigning permissions and rights to a collection of users instead of one at a time. They simplify management and reduce overhead when assigning permissions and rights for a given resource. All users added to a security group will inherit any permissions assigned to the group, making it easier to move users in and out of groups while leaving the group's permissions unchanged.

The `Distribution groups` type is used by email applications such as Microsoft Exchange to distribute messages to group members. They function much like mailing lists and allow for auto-adding emails in the "To" field when creating an email in Microsoft Outlook. This type of group cannot be used to assign permissions to resources in a domain environment.

## Group Scopes

There are three different `group scopes` that can be assigned when creating a new group.

1. Domain Local Group
2. Global Group
3. Universal Group

### **Domain Local Group**

Domain local groups can only be used to manage permissions to domain resources in the domain where it was created. Local groups cannot be used in other domains but `CAN` contain users from `OTHER` domains. Local groups can be nested into (contained within) other local groups but `NOT` within global groups.

### **Global Group**

Global groups can be used to grant access to resources in `another domain`. A global group can only contain accounts from the domain where it was created. Global groups can be added to both other global groups and local groups.

### **Universal Group**

The universal group scope can be used to manage resources distributed across multiple domains and can be given permissions to any object within the same `forest`. They are available to all domains within an organization and can contain users from any domain. Unlike domain local and global groups, universal groups are stored in the Global Catalog (GC), and adding or removing objects from a universal group triggers forest-wide replication. It is recommended that administrators maintain other groups (such as global groups) as members of universal groups because global group membership within universal groups is less likely to change than individual user membership in global groups. Replication is only triggered at the individual domain level when a user is removed from a global group. If individual users and computers (instead of global groups) are maintained within universal groups, it will trigger forest-wide replication each time a change is made. This can create a lot of network overhead and potential for issues.

### **AD Group Scope Examples**

Below is an example of the groups in AD and their scope settings. Please pay attention to some of the critical groups and their scope. ( Enterprise and Schema admins compared to Domain admins, for example.)

```

Group scopes can be changed, but there are a few caveats:

* A Global Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if it is NOT part of another Global Group.
* A Domain Local Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if the Domain Local Group does NOT contain any other Domain Local Groups as members.
* A Universal Group can be converted to a Domain Local Group without any restrictions.
* A Universal Group can only be converted to a Global Group if it does NOT contain any other Universal Groups as members.

## Built-in vs. Custom Groups

Several built-in security groups are created with a Domain Local Group scope when a domain is created. These groups are used for specific administrative purposes and are discussed more in the next section. It is important to note that only user accounts can be added to these built-in groups as they do not allow for group nesting (groups within groups). Some examples of built-in groups included `Domain Admins`, which is a `Global` security group and can only contain accounts from its own domain. If an organization wants to allow an account from domain B to perform administrative functions on a domain controller in domain A, the account would have to be added to the built-in Administrators group, which is a `Domain Local` group. Though Active Directory comes prepopulated with many groups, it is common for most organizations to create additional groups (both security and distribution) for their own purposes. Changes/additions to an AD environment can also trigger the creation of additional groups. For example, when Microsoft Exchange is added to a domain, it adds various different security groups to the domain, some of which are highly privileged and, if not managed properly, can be used to gain privileged access within the domain.

## Nested Group Membership

Nested group membership is an important concept in AD. As mentioned previously, a Domain Local Group can be a member of another Domain Local Group in the same domain. Through this membership, a user may inherit privileges not assigned directly to their account or even the group they are directly a member of, but rather the group that their group is a member of. This can sometimes lead to unintended privileges granted to a user that are difficult to uncover without an in-depth assessment of the domain. Tools such as [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) are particularly useful in uncovering privileges that a user may inherit through one or more nestings of groups. This is a key tool for penetration testers for uncovering nuanced misconfigurations and is also extremely powerful for sysadmins and the like to gain deep insights (visually) into the security posture of their domain(s).

### **Examining Nested Groups via BloodHound**

Below is an example of privileges inherited through nested group membership. Though `DCorner` is not a direct member of `Helpdesk Level 1`, their membership in `Help Desk` grants them the same privileges that any member of `Helpdesk Level 1` has. In this case, the privilege would allow them to add a member to the `Tier 1 Admins` group (`GenericWrite`). If this group confers any elevated privileges in the domain, it would likely be a key target for a penetration tester. Here, we could add our user to the group and obtain privileges that members of the `Tier 1 Admins` group are granted, such as local administrator access to one or more hosts that could be used to further access.

## Important Group Attributes

Like users, groups have many [attributes](http://www.selfadsi.org/group-attributes.htm). Some of the most [important group attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/group-objects) include:

* `cn`: The `cn` or Common-Name is the name of the group in Active Directory Domain Services.
* `member`: Which user, group, and contact objects are members of the group.
* `groupType`: An integer that specifies the group type and scope.
* `memberOf`: A listing of any groups that contain the group as a member (nested group membership).
* `objectSid`: This is the security identifier or SID of the group, which is the unique value used to identify the group as a security principal.

Groups are fundamental objects in AD that can be used to group other objects together and facilitate the management of rights and access. Take the time to study the differences between group types and scopes. This knowledge is useful for administering AD as well as understanding the relationships between groups in the same and different domains and what information can be enumerated during the recon phase of a penetration test. Understanding how different group types can be utilized to perform attacks in a single domain and across trust boundaries is an excellent bit of knowledge to have.
