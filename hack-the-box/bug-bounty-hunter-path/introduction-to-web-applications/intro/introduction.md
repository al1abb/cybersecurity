# Introduction

[Web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) are interactive applications that run on web browsers. Web applications usually adopt a [client-server architecture](https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Client_Server_Architecture) to run and handle interactions. They typically have front end components (i.e., the website interface, or "what the user sees") that run on the client-side (browser) and other back end components (web application source code) that run on the server-side (back end server/databases).

This allows organizations to host powerful applications with near-complete real-time control over their design and functionality while being accessible worldwide. Some examples of typical web applications include online email services like `Gmail`, online retailers like `Amazon`, and online word processors like `Google Docs`.

Web applications are not exclusive to giant providers like Google or Microsoft but can be developed by any web developer and hosted online in any of the common hosting services, to be used by anyone on the internet. This is why today we have millions of web applications all over the internet, with billions of users interacting with them every day.

## Web Applications vs. Websites

In the past, we interacted with websites that are static and cannot be changed in real-time. This means that traditional websites were statically created to represent specific information, and this information would not change with our interaction. To change the website's content, the corresponding page has to be edited by the developers manually. These types of static pages do not contain functions and, therefore, do not produce real-time changes. That type of website is also known as [Web 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0#Web_1.0).

On the other hand, most websites run web applications, or [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) presenting dynamic content based on user interaction. Another significant difference is that web applications are fully functional and can perform various functionalities for the end-user, while web sites lack this type of functionality. Other key differences between traditional websites and web applications include:

* Being modular
* Running on any display size
* Running on any platform without being optimized

## Web Applications vs. Native Operating System Applications

Unlike native operating system (native OS) applications, web applications are platform-independent and can run in a browser on any operating system. These web applications do not have to be installed on a user's system because these web applications and their functionality are executed remotely on the remote server and hence do not consume any space on the end user's hard drive.

Another advantage of web applications over native OS applications is version unity. All users accessing a web application use the same version and the same web application, which can be continuously updated and modified without pushing updates to each user. Web applications can be updated in a single location (webserver) without developing different builds for each platform, which dramatically reduces maintenance and support costs removing the need to communicate changes to all users individually.

On the other hand, native OS applications have certain advantages over web applications, mainly their operation speed and the ability to utilize native operating system libraries and local hardware. As native applications are built to utilize native OS libraries, they are much faster to load and interact with. Furthermore, native applications are usually more capable than web applications, as they have a deeper integration to the operating system and are not limited to the browser's capabilities only.

More recently, however, hybrid and progressive web applications are becoming more common. They utilize modern frameworks to run web applications using native OS capabilities and resources, making them faster than regular web applications and more capable.
