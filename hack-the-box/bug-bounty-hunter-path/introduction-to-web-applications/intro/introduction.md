# Introduction

[Web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) are interactive applications that run on web browsers. Web applications usually adopt a [client-server architecture](https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Client_Server_Architecture) to run and handle interactions. They typically have front end components (i.e., the website interface, or "what the user sees") that run on the client-side (browser) and other back end components (web application source code) that run on the server-side (back end server/databases).

This allows organizations to host powerful applications with near-complete real-time control over their design and functionality while being accessible worldwide. Some examples of typical web applications include online email services like `Gmail`, online retailers like `Amazon`, and online word processors like `Google Docs`.
