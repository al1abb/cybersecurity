# Introduction to Web Services and APIs

As described by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): _Web services provide a standard means of interoperating between different software applications, running on a variety of platforms and/or frameworks. Web services are characterized by their great interoperability and extensibility, as well as their machine-processable descriptions thanks to the use of XML._

Web services enable applications to communicate with each other. The applications can be entirely different. Consider the following scenario:

* One application written in Java is running on a Linux host and is using an Oracle database
* Another application written in C++ is running on a Windows host and is using an SQL Server database

These two applications can communicate with each other over the internet with the help of web services.

An application programming interface (API) is a set of rules that enables data transmission between different software. The technical specification of each API dictates the data exchange.

Consider the following example: A piece of software needs to access information, such as ticket prices for specific dates. To obtain the required information, it will make a call to the API of another software (including how data/functionality must be returned). The other software will return any data/functionality requested.

The interface through which these two pieces of software exchanged data is what the API specifies.

You may think Web Services and APIs are quite similar, and you will be correct. See their major differences below.
