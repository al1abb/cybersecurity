# Credential Hunting

Credentials can unlock many doors for us during our assessments. We may find credentials during our privilege escalation enumeration that can lead directly to local admin access, grant us a foothold into the Active Directory domain environment, or even be used to escalate privileges within the domain. There are many places that we may find credentials on a system, some more obvious than others.

## Application Configuration Files

### **Searching for Files**

Against best practices, applications often store passwords in cleartext config files. Suppose we gain command execution in the context of an unprivileged user account. In that case, we may be able to find credentials for their admin account or another privileged local or domain account. We can use the [findstr](https://ss64.com/nt/findstr.html) utility to search for this sensitive information.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml
```

Sensitive IIS information such as credentials may be stored in a `web.config` file. For the default IIS website, this could be located at `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config`, but there may be multiple versions of this file in different locations, which we can search for recursively.

## Dictionary Files

### **Chrome Dictionary Files**

Another interesting case is dictionary files. For example, sensitive information such as passwords may be entered in an email client or a browser-based application, which underlines any words it doesn't recognize. The user may add these words to their dictionary to avoid the distracting red underline.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> gc 'C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Custom Dictionary.txt' | Select-String password

Password1234!
```

## Unattended Installation Files

Unattended installation files may define auto-logon settings or additional accounts to be created as part of the installation. Passwords in the `unattend.xml` are stored in plaintext or base64 encoded.
