# DnsAdmins

Members of the [DnsAdmins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#dnsadmins) group have access to DNS information on the network. The Windows DNS service supports custom plugins and can call functions from them to resolve name queries that are not in the scope of any locally hosted DNS zones. The DNS service runs as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, so membership in this group could potentially be leveraged to escalate privileges on a Domain Controller or in a situation where a separate server is acting as the DNS server for the domain. It is possible to use the built-in [dnscmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/dnscmd) utility to specify the path of the plugin DLL. As detailed in this excellent [post](https://adsecurity.org/?p=4064), the following attack can be performed when DNS is run on a Domain Controller (which is very common):

* DNS management is performed over RPC
* [ServerLevelPluginDll](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/c9d38538-8827-44e6-aa5e-022a016ed723) allows us to load a custom DLL with zero verification of the DLL's path. This can be done with the `dnscmd` tool from the command line
* When a member of the `DnsAdmins` group runs the `dnscmd` command below, the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\DNS\Parameters\ServerLevelPluginDll` registry key is populated
* When the DNS service is restarted, the DLL in this path will be loaded (i.e., a network share that the Domain Controller's machine account can access)
* An attacker can load a custom DLL to obtain a reverse shell or even load a tool such as Mimikatz as a DLL to dump credentials.

Let's step through the attack.
