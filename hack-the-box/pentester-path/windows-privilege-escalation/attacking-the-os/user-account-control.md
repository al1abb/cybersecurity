# User Account Control

[User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) is a feature that enables a consent prompt for elevated activities. Applications have different `integrity` levels, and a program with a high level can perform tasks that could potentially compromise the system. When UAC is enabled, applications and tasks always run under the security context of a non-administrator account unless an administrator explicitly authorizes these applications/tasks to have administrator-level access to the system to run. It is a convenience feature that protects administrators from unintended changes but is not considered a security boundary.

When UAC is in place, a user can log into their system with their standard user account. When processes are launched using a standard user token, they can perform tasks using the rights granted to a standard user. Some applications require additional permissions to run, and UAC can provide additional access rights to the token for them to run correctly.

This [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) discusses how UAC works in great depth and includes the logon process, user experience, and UAC architecture. Administrators can use security policies to configure how UAC works specific to their organization at the local level (using secpol.msc), or configured and pushed out via Group Policy Objects (GPO) in an Active Directory domain environment. The various settings are discussed in detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/user-account-control-security-policy-settings). There are 10 Group Policy settings that can be set for UAC. The following table provides additional detail:

UAC should be enabled, and although it may not stop an attacker from gaining privileges, it is an extra step that may slow this process down and force them to become noisier.

The `default RID 500 administrator` account always operates at the high mandatory level. With Admin Approval Mode (AAM) enabled, any new admin accounts we create will operate at the medium mandatory level by default and be assigned two separate access tokens upon logging in. In the example below, the user account `sarah` is in the administrators group, but cmd.exe is currently running in the context of their unprivileged access token.

### **Checking Current User**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> whoami /user

USER INFORMATION
----------------

User Name         SID
================= ==============================================
winlpe-ws03\sarah S-1-5-21-3159276091-2191180989-3781274054-1002
```

### **Confirming Admin Group Membership**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net localgroup administrators

Alias name     administrators
Comment        Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator
mrb3n
sarah
The command completed successfully.
```

### **Reviewing User Privileges**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                          State
============================= ==================================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeUndockPrivilege             Remove computer from docking station Disabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                 Disabled
```

### **Confirming UAC is Enabled**

There is no command-line version of the GUI consent prompt, so we will have to bypass UAC to execute commands with our privileged access token. First, let's confirm if UAC is enabled and, if so, at what level.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> REG QUERY HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ /v EnableLUA

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
    EnableLUA    REG_DWORD    0x1
```

### **Checking UAC Level**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> REG QUERY HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
    ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin    REG_DWORD    0x5
```

The value of `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` is `0x5`, which means the highest UAC level of `Always notify` is enabled. There are fewer UAC bypasses at this highest level.

### **Checking Windows Version**

UAC bypasses leverage flaws or unintended functionality in different Windows builds. Let's examine the build of Windows we're looking to elevate on.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> [environment]::OSVersion.Version

Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
10     0      14393  0
```

This returns the build version 14393, which using [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_version_history) page we cross-reference to Windows release `1607`.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (373).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The [UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME) project maintains a list of UAC bypasses, including information on the affected Windows build number, the technique used, and if Microsoft has issued a security update to fix it. Let's use technique number 54, which is stated to work from Windows 10 build 14393. This technique targets the 32-bit version of the auto-elevating binary `SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe`. There are many trusted binaries that Windows will allow to auto-elevate without the need for a UAC consent prompt.

According to [this](https://egre55.github.io/system-properties-uac-bypass) blog post, the 32-bit version of `SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe` attempts to load the non-existent DLL srrstr.dll, which is used by System Restore functionality.

When attempting to locate a DLL, Windows will use the following search order.

1. The directory from which the application loaded.
2. The system directory `C:\Windows\System32` for 64-bit systems.
3. The 16-bit system directory `C:\Windows\System` (not supported on 64-bit systems)
4. The Windows directory.
5. Any directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.
