# User Account Control

[User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) is a feature that enables a consent prompt for elevated activities. Applications have different `integrity` levels, and a program with a high level can perform tasks that could potentially compromise the system. When UAC is enabled, applications and tasks always run under the security context of a non-administrator account unless an administrator explicitly authorizes these applications/tasks to have administrator-level access to the system to run. It is a convenience feature that protects administrators from unintended changes but is not considered a security boundary.

When UAC is in place, a user can log into their system with their standard user account. When processes are launched using a standard user token, they can perform tasks using the rights granted to a standard user. Some applications require additional permissions to run, and UAC can provide additional access rights to the token for them to run correctly.

This [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) discusses how UAC works in great depth and includes the logon process, user experience, and UAC architecture. Administrators can use security policies to configure how UAC works specific to their organization at the local level (using secpol.msc), or configured and pushed out via Group Policy Objects (GPO) in an Active Directory domain environment. The various settings are discussed in detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/user-account-control-security-policy-settings). There are 10 Group Policy settings that can be set for UAC. The following table provides additional detail:
