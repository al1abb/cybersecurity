# Tomcat - Discovery & Enumeration

[Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) is an open-source web server that hosts applications written in Java. Tomcat was initially designed to run Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP) scripts. However, its popularity increased in Java-based frameworks and is now widely used by frameworks such as Spring and tools such as Gradle. According to data gathered by [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/Web-Server/Apache-Tomcat-Coyote) there are over 220,000 live Tomcat websites at this time. Here are a few more interesting statistics:

* BuiltWith has gathered data that shows that over 904,000 websites have at one point been using Tomcat
* 1.22% of the top 1 million websites are using Tomcat, while 3.8% of the top 100k websites are
* Tomcat holds position [# 13](https://webtechsurvey.com/technology/apache-tomcat) for web servers by market share
* Some organizations that use Tomcat include Alibaba, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), The American Red Cross, and the LA Times

Tomcat is often less apt to be exposed to the internet (though). We see it from time to time on external pentests and can make for an excellent foothold into the internal network. It is far more common to see Tomcat (and multiple instances, for that matter) during internal pentests. It'll usually occupy the first spot under "High Value Targets" within an EyeWitness report, and more often than not, at least one instance internal is configured with weak or default credentials. More on that later.
