# Attacking GitLab

As we saw in the previous section, even unauthenticated access to a GitLab instance could lead to sensitive data compromise. If we were able to gain access as a valid company user or an admin, we could potentially uncover enough data to fully compromise the organization in some way. GitLab has [553 CVEs](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13074/Gitlab.html) reported as of September 2021. While not every single one is exploitable, there have been several severe ones over the years that could lead to remote code execution.
