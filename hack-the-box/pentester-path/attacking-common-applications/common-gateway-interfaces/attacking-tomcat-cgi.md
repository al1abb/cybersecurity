# Attacking Tomcat CGI

`CVE-2019-0232` is a critical security issue that could result in remote code execution. This vulnerability affects Windows systems that have the `enableCmdLineArguments` feature enabled. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by exploiting a command injection flaw resulting from a Tomcat CGI Servlet input validation error, thus allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. Versions `9.0.0.M1` to `9.0.17`, `8.5.0` to `8.5.39`, and `7.0.0` to `7.0.93` of Tomcat are affected.

The CGI Servlet is a vital component of Apache Tomcat that enables web servers to communicate with external applications beyond the Tomcat JVM. These external applications are typically CGI scripts written in languages like Perl, Python, or Bash. The CGI Servlet receives requests from web browsers and forwards them to CGI scripts for processing.

In essence, a CGI Servlet is a program that runs on a web server, such as Apache2, to support the execution of external applications that conform to the CGI specification. It is a middleware between web servers and external information resources like databases.

CGI scripts are utilised in websites for several reasons, but there are also some pretty big disadvantages to using them:
