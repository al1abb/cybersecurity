# Attacking Tomcat CGI

`CVE-2019-0232` is a critical security issue that could result in remote code execution. This vulnerability affects Windows systems that have the `enableCmdLineArguments` feature enabled. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by exploiting a command injection flaw resulting from a Tomcat CGI Servlet input validation error, thus allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. Versions `9.0.0.M1` to `9.0.17`, `8.5.0` to `8.5.39`, and `7.0.0` to `7.0.93` of Tomcat are affected.

The CGI Servlet is a vital component of Apache Tomcat that enables web servers to communicate with external applications beyond the Tomcat JVM. These external applications are typically CGI scripts written in languages like Perl, Python, or Bash. The CGI Servlet receives requests from web browsers and forwards them to CGI scripts for processing.

In essence, a CGI Servlet is a program that runs on a web server, such as Apache2, to support the execution of external applications that conform to the CGI specification. It is a middleware between web servers and external information resources like databases.

CGI scripts are utilised in websites for several reasons, but there are also some pretty big disadvantages to using them:

| It is simple and effective for generating dynamic web content.                               | Incurs overhead by having to load programs into memory for each request.   |
| Use any programming language that can read from standard input and write to standard output. | Cannot easily cache data in memory between page requests.                  |
| Can reuse existing code and avoid writing new code.                                          | It reduces the server's performance and consumes a lot of processing time. |

The `enableCmdLineArguments` setting for Apache Tomcat's CGI Servlet controls whether command line arguments are created from the query string. If set to true, the CGI Servlet parses the query string and passes it to the CGI script as arguments. This feature can make CGI scripts more flexible and easier to write by allowing parameters to be passed to the script without using environment variables or standard input. For example, a CGI script can use command line arguments to switch between actions based on user input.

Suppose you have a CGI script that allows users to search for books in a bookstore's catalogue. The script has two possible actions: "search by title" and "search by author."

The CGI script can use command line arguments to switch between these actions. For instance, the script can be called with the following URL:

```http
http://example.com/cgi-bin/booksearch.cgi?action=title&query=the+great+gatsby
```

Here, the `action` parameter is set to `title`, indicating that the script should search by book title. The `query` parameter specifies the search term "the great gatsby."

If the user wants to search by author, they can use a similar URL:
