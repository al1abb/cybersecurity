# Credential Hunting in Network Traffic

In today's security-conscious world, most applications wisely use TLS to encrypt sensitive data in transit. However, not all environments are fully secured. Legacy systems, misconfigured services, or test applications launched without HTTPS can still result in the use of unencrypted protocols such as HTTP or SNMP. These gaps present a valuable opportunity for attackers: `the chance to hunt for credentials in cleartext network traffic`. In this section, we'll explore practical techniques for identifying exposed information, such as usernames and passwords within common plaintext protocols using Wireshark. We'll also take a brief look at [Pcredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz), a tool that can quickly scan network traffic for such data.

The table below lists several common protocols alongside their encrypted counterparts. While it is now more common to encounter the secure versions, there was a time when plaintext protocols were widely used.

<table><thead><tr><th width="179">Unencrypted Protocol</th><th width="229.45452880859375">Encrypted Counterpart</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>HTTP</code></td><td><code>HTTPS</code></td><td>Used for transferring web pages and resources over the internet.</td></tr><tr><td><code>FTP</code></td><td><code>FTPS/SFTP</code></td><td>Used for transferring files between a client and a server.</td></tr><tr><td><code>SNMP</code></td><td><code>SNMPv3 (with encryption)</code></td><td>Used for monitoring and managing network devices like routers and switches.</td></tr><tr><td><code>POP3</code></td><td><code>POP3S</code></td><td>Retrieves emails from a mail server to a local client.</td></tr><tr><td><code>IMAP</code></td><td><code>IMAPS</code></td><td>Accesses and manages email messages directly on the mail server.</td></tr><tr><td><code>SMTP</code></td><td><code>SMTPS</code></td><td>Sends email messages from client to server or between mail servers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>LDAP</code></td><td><code>LDAPS</code></td><td>Queries and modifies directory services like user credentials and roles.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RDP</code></td><td><code>RDP (with TLS)</code></td><td>Provides remote desktop access to Windows systems.</td></tr><tr><td><code>DNS (Traditional)</code></td><td><code>DNS over HTTPS (DoH)</code></td><td>Resolves domain names into IP addresses.</td></tr><tr><td><code>SMB</code></td><td><code>SMB over TLS (SMB 3.0)</code></td><td>Shares files, printers, and other resources over a network.</td></tr><tr><td><code>VNC</code></td><td><code>VNC with TLS/SSL</code></td><td>Allows graphical remote control of another computer.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Wireshark

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is well known packet analyzer that comes pre-installed nearly all penetration testing Linux distributions. It features a powerful [filter engine](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark-filter.html) that allows for efficient searching through both live and captured network traffic. Some basic but useful filters include:

<table><thead><tr><th width="281.27276611328125">Wireshark filter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>ip.addr == 56.48.210.13</code></td><td>Filters packets with a specific IP address</td></tr><tr><td><code>tcp.port == 80</code></td><td>Filters packets by port (HTTP in this case).</td></tr><tr><td><code>http</code></td><td>Filters for HTTP traffic.</td></tr><tr><td><code>dns</code></td><td>Filters DNS traffic, which is useful to monitor domain name resolution.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tcp.flags.syn == 1 &#x26;&#x26; tcp.flags.ack == 0</code></td><td>Filters SYN packets (used in TCP handshakes), useful for detecting scanning or connection attempts.</td></tr><tr><td><code>icmp</code></td><td>Filters ICMP packets (used for Ping), which can be useful for reconnaissance or network issues.</td></tr><tr><td><code>http.request.method == "POST"</code></td><td>Filters for HTTP POST requests. In the case that POST requests are sent over unencrypted HTTP, it may be the case that passwords or other sensitive information is contained within.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tcp.stream eq 53</code></td><td>Filters for a specific TCP stream. Helps track a conversation between two hosts.</td></tr><tr><td><code>eth.addr == 00:11:22:33:44:55</code></td><td>Filters packets from/to a specific MAC address.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ip.src == 192.168.24.3 &#x26;&#x26; ip.dst == 56.48.210.3</code></td><td>Filters traffic between two specific IP addresses. Helps track communication between specific hosts.</td></tr></tbody></table>

For example, in the image below we are filtering for unencrypted `HTTP` traffic.

In Wireshark, it's possible to locate packets that contain specific bytes or strings. One way to do this is by using a display filter such as `http contains "passw"`. Alternatively, you can navigate to `Edit > Find Packet` and enter the desired search query manually. For example, you might search for packets containing the string `"passw"`:

It's worth familiarizing yourself with the syntax of Wireshark's filtering engine, especially if you ever need to perform network traffic analysis.

## Pcredz

[Pcredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz) is a tool that can be used to extract credentials from live traffic or network packet captures. Specifically, it supports extracting the following information:

* Credit card numbers
* POP credentials
* SMTP credentials
* IMAP credentials
* SNMP community strings
* FTP credentials
* Credentials from HTTP NTLM/Basic headers, as well as HTTP Forms
* NTLMv1/v2 hashes from various traffic including DCE-RPC, SMBv1/2, LDAP, MSSQL, and HTTP
* Kerberos (AS-REQ Pre-Auth etype 23) hashes

In order to run `Pcredz`, one may either clone the repository and install all dependencies, or use the provided Docker container detailed in the [Install](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz?tab=readme-ov-file#install) portion of the README file.

The following command can be used to run `Pcredz` against a packet capture file:

```shell-session
$ ./Pcredz -f demo.pcapng -t -v

Pcredz 2.0.2
Author: Laurent Gaffie
Please send bugs/comments/pcaps to: laurent.gaffie@gmail.com
This script will extract NTLM (HTTP,LDAP,SMB,MSSQL,RPC, etc), Kerberos,
FTP, HTTP Basic and credit card data from a given pcap file or from a live interface.
