# Pass the Hash (PtH)

A [Pass the Hash (PtH)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication. The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.

As discussed in the previous sections, the attacker must have administrative privileges or particular privileges on the target machine to obtain a password hash. Hashes can be obtained in several ways, including:

* Dumping the local SAM database from a compromised host.
* Extracting hashes from the NTDS database (ntds.dit) on a Domain Controller.
* Pulling the hashes from memory (lsass.exe).

Let's assume we obtain the password hash (`64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B`) for the account `julio` from the domain `inlanefreight.htb`. Let's see how we can perform Pass the Hash attacks from Windows and Linux machines.

Note: The tools we will be using are located in the C:\tools directory on the target host. Once you start the machine and complete the exercises, you can use the tools in that directory. This lab contains two machines, you will have access to one (MS01), and from there, you will connect to the second machine (DC01).
