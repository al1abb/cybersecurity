# Credential Hunting in Linux

Hunting for credentials is one of the first steps once we have access to the system. These low-hanging fruits can give us elevated privileges within seconds or minutes. Among other things, this is part of the local privilege escalation process that we will cover here. However, it is important to note here that we are far from covering all possible situations and therefore focus on the different approaches.

We can imagine that we have successfully gained access to a system via a vulnerable web application and have therefore obtained a reverse shell, for example. Therefore, to escalate our privileges most efficiently, we can search for passwords or even whole credentials that we can use to log in to our target. There are several sources that can provide us with credentials that we put in four categories. These include, but are not limited to:

| **`Files`**  | **`History`**        | **`Memory`**         | **`Key-Rings`**            |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Configs      | Logs                 | Cache                | Browser stored credentials |
| Databases    | Command-line History | In-memory Processing |                            |
| Notes        |                      |                      |                            |
| Scripts      |                      |                      |                            |
| Source codes |                      |                      |                            |
| Cronjobs     |                      |                      |                            |
| SSH Keys     |                      |                      |                            |

Enumerating all these categories will allow us to increase the probability of successfully finding out with some ease credentials of existing users on the system. There are countless different situations in which we will always see different results. Therefore, we should adapt our approach to the circumstances of the environment and keep the big picture in mind. Above all, it is crucial to keep in mind how the system works, its focus, what purpose it exists for, and what role it plays in the business logic and the overall network. For example, suppose it is an isolated database server. In that case, we will not necessarily find normal users there since it is a sensitive interface in the management of data to which only a few people are granted access.

## Files

One core principle of Linux is that everything is a file. Therefore, it is crucial to keep this concept in mind and search, find and filter the appropriate files according to our requirements. We should look for, find, and inspect several categories of files one by one. These categories are the following:

| Configuration files | Databases | Notes    |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Scripts             | Cronjobs  | SSH keys |

Configuration files are the core of the functionality of services on Linux distributions. Often they even contain credentials that we will be able to read. Their insight also allows us to understand how the service works and its requirements precisely. Usually, the configuration files are marked with the following three file extensions (`.config`, `.conf`, `.cnf`). However, these configuration files or the associated extension files can be renamed, which means that these file extensions are not necessarily required. Furthermore, even when recompiling a service, the required filename for the basic configuration can be changed, which would result in the same effect. However, this is a rare case that we will not encounter often, but this possibility should not be left out of our search.

The most crucial part of any system enumeration is to obtain an overview of it. Therefore, the first step should be to find all possible configuration files on the system, which we can then examine and analyze individually in more detail. There are many methods to find these configuration files, and with the following method, we will see we have reduced our search to these three file extensions.
