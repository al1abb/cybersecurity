# SQLMap Output Description

At the end of the previous section, the sqlmap output showed us a lot of info during its scan. This data is usually crucial to understand, as it guides us through the automated SQL injection process. This shows us exactly what kind of vulnerabilities SQLMap is exploiting, which helps us report what type of injection the web application has. This can also become handy if we wanted to manually exploit the web application once SQLMap determines the type of injection and vulnerable parameter.
