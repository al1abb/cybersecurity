# Initial Enumeration of the Domain

We are at the very beginning of our AD-focused penetration test against Inlanefreight. We have done some basic information gathering and gotten a picture of what to expect from the customer via the scoping documents.

## Setting Up

For this first portion of the test, we are starting on an attack host placed inside the network for us. This is one common way that a client might select for us to perform an internal penetration test. A list of the types of setups a client may choose for testing includes:

* A penetration testing distro (typically Linux) as a virtual machine in their internal infrastructure that calls back to a jump host we control over VPN, and we can SSH into.
* A physical device plugged into an ethernet port that calls back to us over VPN, and we can SSH into.
* A physical presence at their office with our laptop plugged into an ethernet port.
* A Linux VM in either Azure or AWS with access to the internal network that we can SSH into using public key authentication and our public IP address whitelisted.
* VPN access into their internal network (a bit limiting because we will not be able to perform certain attacks such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning).
* From a corporate laptop connected to the client's VPN.
* On a managed workstation (typically Windows), physically sitting in their office with limited or no internet access or ability to pull in tools. They may also elect this option but give you full internet access, local admin, and put endpoint protection into monitor mode so you can pull in tools at will.
* On a VDI (virtual desktop) accessed using Citrix or the like, with one of the configurations described for the managed workstation typically accessible over VPN either remotely or from a corporate laptop.

These are the most common setups I have seen, though a client may come up with another variation of one of these. The client may also choose from a "grey box" approach where they give us just a list of in-scope IP addresses/CIDR network ranges, or "black box" where we have to plug in and do all discovery blindly using various techniques. Finally, they can choose either evasive, non-evasive, or hybrid evasive (starting "quiet" and slowly getting louder to see what threshold we are detected at and then switching to non-evasive testing. They may also elect to have us start with no credentials or from the perspective of a standard domain user.

Our customer Inlanefreight has chosen the following approach because they are looking for as comprehensive an assessment as possible. At this time, their security program is not mature enough to benefit from any form of evasive testing or a "black box" approach.

* A custom pentest VM within their internal network that calls back to our jump host, and we can SSH into it to perform testing.
* They've also given us a Windows host that we can load tools onto if need be.
* They've asked us to start from an unauthenticated standpoint but have also given us a standard domain user account (`htb-student`) which can be used to access the Windows attack host.
* "Grey box" testing. They have given us the network range 172.16.5.0/23 and no other information about the network.
* Non-evasive testing.

We have not been provided credentials or a detailed internal network map.

## Tasks

Our tasks to accomplish for this section are:

* Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
* This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
* Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!

We will start from our Linux attack host without domain user credentials. It's a common thing to start a pentest off in this manner. Many organizations will wish to see what you can do from a blind perspective, such as this, before providing you with further information for the test. It gives a more realistic look at what potential avenues an adversary would have to use to infiltrate the domain. It can help them see what an attacker could do if they gain unauthorized access via the internet (i.e., a phishing attack), physical access to the building, wireless access from outside (if the wireless network touches the AD environment), or even a rogue employee. Depending on the success of this phase, the customer may provide us with access to a domain-joined host or a set of credentials for the network to expedite testing and allow us to cover as much ground as possible.

Below are some of the key data points that we should be looking for at this time and noting down into our notetaking tool of choice and saving scan/tool output to files whenever possible.

## TTPs

Enumerating an AD environment can be overwhelming if just approached without a plan. There is an abundance of data stored in AD, and it can take a long time to sift if not looked at in progressive stages, and we will likely miss things. We need to set a game plan for ourselves and tackle it piece by piece. Everyone works in slightly different ways, so as we gain more experience, we'll start to develop our own repeatable methodology that works best for us. Regardless of how we proceed, we typically start in the same place and look for the same data points. We will experiment with many tools in this section and subsequent ones. It is important to reproduce every example and even try to recreate examples with different tools to see how they work differently, learn their syntax, and find what approach works best for us.

We will start with `passive` identification of any hosts in the network, followed by `active` validation of the results to find out more about each host (what services are running, names, potential vulnerabilities, etc.). Once we know what hosts exist, we can proceed with probing those hosts, looking for any interesting data we can glean from them. After we have accomplished these tasks, we should stop and regroup and look at what info we have. At this time, we'll hopefully have a set of credentials or a user account to target for a foothold onto a domain-joined host or have the ability to begin credentialed enumeration from our Linux attack host.

Let's look at a few tools and techniques to help us with this enumeration.

### Identifying Hosts

First, let's take some time to listen to the network and see what's going on. We can use `Wireshark` and `TCPDump` to "put our ear to the wire" and see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. This is particularly helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) requests and replies, [MDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), and other basic [layer two](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-understanding.html) packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain) some of which we can see below. This is a great start that gives us a few bits of information about the customer's network setup.

Scroll to the bottom, spawn the target, connect to the Linux attack host using `xfreerdp` and fire up Wireshark to begin capturing traffic.

### **Start Wireshark on ea-attack01**

```shell-session
┌─[htb-student@ea-attack01]─[~]
└──╼ $sudo -E wireshark

11:28:20.487     Main Warn QStandardPaths: runtime directory '/run/user/1001' is not owned by UID 0, but a directory permissions 0700 owned by UID 1001 GID 1002
<SNIP>
```

### **Wireshark Output**

* ARP packets make us aware of the hosts: 172.16.5.5, 172.16.5.25 172.16.5.50, 172.16.5.100, and 172.16.5.125.

* MDNS makes us aware of the ACADEMY-EA-WEB01 host.

If we are on a host without a GUI (which is typical), we can use [tcpdump](https://linux.die.net/man/8/tcpdump), [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds), and [NetMiner](https://www.netminer.com/en/product/netminer.php), etc., to perform the same functions. We can also use tcpdump to save a capture to a .pcap file, transfer it to another host, and open it in Wireshark.

### **Tcpdump Output**

```shell-session
al1abb@htb[/htb]$ sudo tcpdump -i ens224
```
