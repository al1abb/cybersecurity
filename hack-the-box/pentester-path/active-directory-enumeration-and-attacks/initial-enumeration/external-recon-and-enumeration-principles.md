# External Recon and Enumeration Principles

Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform `external reconnaissance` of your target. This can serve many different functions, such as:

* Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
* Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
* Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials

Think of it like this; we are trying to get the `lay of the land` to ensure we provide the most comprehensive test possible for our customer. That also means identifying any potential information leaks and breach data out in the world. This can be as simple as gleaning a username format from the customer's main website or social media. We may also dive as deep as scanning GitHub repositories for credentials left in code pushes, hunting in documents for links to an intranet or remotely accessible sites, and just looking for any information that can key us in on how the enterprise environment is configured.
