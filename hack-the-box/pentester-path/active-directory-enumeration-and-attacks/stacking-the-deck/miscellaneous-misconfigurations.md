# Miscellaneous Misconfigurations

There are many other attacks and interesting misconfigurations that we may come across during an assessment. A broad understanding of the ins and outs of AD will help us think outside the box and discover issues that others are likely to miss.

## Scenario Setup

In this section, we will move back and forth between a Windows and Linux attack host as we work through the various examples. You can spawn the hosts for this section at the end of this section and RDP into the MS01 Windows attack host. For the portions of this section that require interaction from a Linux host, you can open a PowerShell console on MS01 and SSH to `172.16.5.225` with the credentials `htb-student:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`
