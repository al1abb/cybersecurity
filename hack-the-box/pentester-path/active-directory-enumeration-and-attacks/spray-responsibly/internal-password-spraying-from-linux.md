# Internal Password Spraying - from Linux

Now that we have created a wordlist using one of the methods outlined in the previous sections, it’s time to execute our attack. The following sections will let us practice Password Spraying from Linux and Windows hosts. This is a key focus for us as it is one of two main avenues for gaining domain credentials for access, but one that we also must proceed with cautiously.

## Internal Password Spraying from a Linux Host

Once we’ve created a wordlist using one of the methods shown in the previous section, it’s time to execute the attack. `Rpcclient` is an excellent option for performing this attack from Linux.
