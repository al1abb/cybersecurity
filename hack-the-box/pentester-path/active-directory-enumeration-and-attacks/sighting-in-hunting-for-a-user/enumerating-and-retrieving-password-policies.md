# Enumerating & Retrieving Password Policies

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - Credentialed

As stated in the previous section, we can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured and whether or not we have valid domain credentials. With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) or `rpcclient`.

```shell-session
$ crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123 --pass-pol

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - SMB NULL Sessions

Without credentials, we may be able to obtain the password policy via an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind. The first is via an SMB NULL session. SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

When creating a domain in earlier versions of Windows Server, anonymous access was granted to certain shares, which allowed for domain enumeration. An SMB NULL session can be enumerated easily. For enumeration, we can use tools such as `enum4linux`, `CrackMapExec`, `rpcclient`, etc.

We can use [rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) to check a Domain Controller for SMB NULL session access.

Once connected, we can issue an RPC command such as `querydominfo` to obtain information about the domain and confirm NULL session access.

### **Using rpcclient**

```shell-session
$ rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

rpcclient $> querydominfo
Domain:		INLANEFREIGHT
Server:		
Comment:	
Total Users:	3650
Total Groups:	0
Total Aliases:	37
Sequence No:	1
Force Logoff:	-1
Domain Server State:	0x1
Server Role:	ROLE_DOMAIN_PDC
Unknown 3:	0x1
```

### **Obtaining the Password Policy using rpcclient**

We can also obtain the password policy. We can see that the password policy is relatively weak, allowing a minimum password of 8 characters.

```shell-session
rpcclient $> querydominfo

Domain:		INLANEFREIGHT
Server:		
Comment:	
Total Users:	3650
Total Groups:	0
Total Aliases:	37
Sequence No:	1
Force Logoff:	-1
Domain Server State:	0x1
Server Role:	ROLE_DOMAIN_PDC
Unknown 3:	0x1
rpcclient $> getdompwinfo
min_password_length: 8
password_properties: 0x00000001
	DOMAIN_PASSWORD_COMPLEX
```

Let's try this using [enum4linux](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux). `enum4linux` is a tool built around the [Samba suite of tools](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/samba.7.html) `nmblookup`, `net`, `rpcclient` and `smbclient` to use for enumeration of windows hosts and domains. It can be found pre-installed on many different penetration testing distros, including Parrot Security Linux. Below we have an example output displaying information that can be provided by `enum4linux`. Here are some common enumeration tools and the ports they use:

<table><thead><tr><th width="147.18182373046875">Tool</th><th>Ports</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>nmblookup</td><td>137/UDP</td></tr><tr><td>nbtstat</td><td>137/UDP</td></tr><tr><td>net</td><td>139/TCP, 135/TCP, TCP and UDP 135 and 49152-65535</td></tr><tr><td>rpcclient</td><td>135/TCP</td></tr><tr><td>smbclient</td><td>445/TCP</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Using enum4linux**

```shell-session
$ enum4linux -P 172.16.5.5

The tool [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng) is a rewrite of `enum4linux` in Python, but has additional features such as the ability to export data as YAML or JSON files which can later be used to process the data further or feed it to other tools. It also supports colored output, among other features

### **Using enum4linux-ng**

```shell-session
$ enum4linux-ng -P 172.16.5.5 -oA ilfreight
