# Notetaking & Organization

Thorough notetaking is critical during any assessment. Our notes, accompanied by tool and log output, are the raw inputs to our draft report, which is typically the only portion of our assessment that our client sees. Even though we usually keep our notes for ourselves, we must keep things organized and develop a repeatable process to save time and facilitate the reporting process. Detailed notes are also a must in the event of a network issue or client question (i.e., did you scan X host on Y day?), so being overly verbose in our notetaking never hurts. Everyone will have their own style they are comfortable with and should work with their preferred tools and organizational structure to ensure the best possible results. In this module, we will cover the minimum elements that, from our professional experience, should be noted down during an assessment (or even while working through a large module, playing a box on HTB, or taking an exam) to save time and energy come reporting time or as a reference guide down the road. If you're part of a larger team where someone may have to cover a client meeting for you, clear and consistent notes are essential to ensure your teammate can speak confidently and accurately about what activities were and were not performed.

## Notetaking Sample Structure

There is no universal solution or structure for notetaking as each project and tester is different. The structure below is what we have found to be helpful but should be adapted to your personal workflow, project type, and the specific circumstances you encountered during your project. For example, some of these categories may not be applicable for an application-focused assessment and may even warrant additional categories not listed here.

* `Attack Path` - An outline of the entire path if you gain a foothold during an external penetration test or compromise one or more hosts (or the AD domain) during an internal penetration test. Outline the path as closely as possible using screenshots and command output will make it easier to paste into the report later and only need to worry about formatting.
* `Credentials` - A centralized place to keep your compromised credentials and secrets as you go along.
* `Findings` - We recommend creating a subfolder for each finding and then writing our narrative and saving it in the folder along with any evidence (screenshots, command output). It is also worth keeping a section in your notetaking tool for recording findings information to help organize them for the report.
* `Vulnerability Scan Research` - A section to take notes on things you've researched and tried with your vulnerability scans (so you don't end up redoing work you already did).
* `Service Enumeration Research` - A section to take notes on which services you've investigated, failed exploitation attempts, promising vulnerabilities/misconfigurations, etc.
* `Web Application Research` - A section to note down interesting web applications found through various methods, such as subdomain brute-forcing. It's always good to perform thorough subdomain enumeration externally, scan for common web ports on internal assessments, and run a tool such as Aquatone or EyeWitness to screenshot all applications. As you review the screenshot report, note down applications of interest, common/default credential pairs you tried, etc.
* `AD Enumeration Research` - A section for showing, step-by-step, what Active Directory enumeration you've already performed. Note down any areas of interest you need to run down later in the assessment.
* `OSINT` - A section to keep track of interesting information you've collected via OSINT, if applicable to the engagement.
* `Administrative Information` - Some people may find it helpful to have a centralized location to store contact information for other project stakeholders like Project Managers (PMs) or client Points of Contact (POCs), unique objectives/flags defined in the Rules of Engagement (RoE), and other items that you find yourself often referencing throughout the project. It can also be used as a running to-do list. As ideas pop up for testing that you need to perform or want to try but don't have time for, be diligent about writing them down here so you can come back to them later.
* `Scoping Information` - Here, we can store information about in-scope IP addresses/CIDR ranges, web application URLs, and any credentials for web applications, VPN, or AD provided by the client. It could also include anything else pertinent to the scope of the assessment so we don't have to keep re-opening scope information and ensure that we don't stray from the scope of the assessment.
* `Activity Log` - High-level tracking of everything you did during the assessment for possible event correlation.
* `Payload Log` - Similar to the activity log, tracking the payloads you're using (and a file hash for anything uploaded and the upload location) in a client environment is critical. More on this later.

## Notetaking Tools

There are many tools available for notetaking, and the choice is very much personal preference. Here are some of the options available:

|                                                       |                                                      |                                              |

As a team, we've had many discussions about the pros and cons of various notetaking tools. One key factor is distinguishing between local and cloud solutions before choosing a tool. A cloud solution is likely acceptable for training courses, CTFs, labs, etc., but once we get into engagements and managing client data, we must be more careful with the solution we choose. Your company will likely have some sort of policy or contractual obligations around data storage, so it is best to consult with your manager or team lead on whether or not using a specific notetaking tool is permitted. `Obsidian` is an excellent solution for local storage, and `Outline` is great for the cloud but also has a [Self-hosted version](https://github.com/outline/outline). Both tools can be exported to Markdown and imported into any other tool that accepts this convenient format.
