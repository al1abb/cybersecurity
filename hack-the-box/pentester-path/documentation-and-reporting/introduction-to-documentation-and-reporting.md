# Introduction to Documentation and Reporting

Strong documentation and reporting skills are incredibly beneficial in any area of Information Technology or Information Security, and mastering these skills can help us quickly progress in our careers. Being highly technical is great and essential, but without soft skills to back up our technical pwning skills, we won't be as effective whether we are writing internal policies and procedures, technical documentation, penetration test reports, or other types of client deliverables.

There is no "one size fits all" for notetaking and preparing reports, but there are fundamental principles that must be followed to be successful. This module will explore different styles from notetaking tools, organizing our evidence on our testing VM, writing up Executive Summaries for non-technical audiences, and documenting Attack Chains and technical findings. We attempted to provide a generic formula that anyone can use to achieve success while sprinkling in tips, tricks, and best practices that we have learned from around 25 combined years in various client-facing technical consulting and managerial roles.

One crucial consideration for us as testers is a penetration test is a snapshot in time of the target network's security status. We should include an overview section in our report that talks about the type of work performed, who performed it, source IP addresses used in testing, and any special considerations (i.e., testing performed remotely over VPN or from a host within the client's network). This overview should also state that our testing was performed during a specific period and that any changes to in-scope systems and resultant vulnerabilities would not be captured in this report deliverable. We could state: "All testing activities were performed between January 7, 2022 and January 19, 2022." We could also add a disclaimer, such as "This report represents a snapshot in time during the aforementioned testing period, and Acme Consulting, LLC cannot attest to the state of any client-owned information assets outside of this testing window."
