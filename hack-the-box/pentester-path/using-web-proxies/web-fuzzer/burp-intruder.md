# Burp Intruder

Both Burp and ZAP provide additional features other than the default web proxy, which are essential for web application penetration testing. Two of the most important extra features are `web fuzzers` and `web scanners`. The built-in web fuzzers are powerful tools that act as web fuzzing, enumeration, and brute-forcing tools. This may also act as an alternative for many of the CLI-based fuzzers we use, like `ffuf`, `dirbuster`, `gobuster`, `wfuzz`, among others.

Burp's web fuzzer is called `Burp Intruder`, and can be used to fuzz pages, directories, sub-domains, parameters, parameters values, and many other things. Though it is much more advanced than most CLI-based web fuzzing tools, the free `Burp Community` version is throttled at a speed of 1 request per second, making it extremely slow compared to CLI-based web fuzzing tools, which can usually read up to 10k requests per second. This is why we would only use the free version of Burp Intruder for short queries. The `Pro` version has unlimited speed, which can rival common web fuzzing tools, in addition to the very useful features of Burp Intruder. This makes it one of the best web fuzzing and brute-forcing tools.

In this section, we will demonstrate the various uses of Burp Intruder for web fuzzing and enumeration.
