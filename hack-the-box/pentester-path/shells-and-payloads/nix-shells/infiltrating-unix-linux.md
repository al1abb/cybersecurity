# Infiltrating Unix/Linux

W3Techs maintains an ongoing OS usage statistics [study](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system). This study reports that over `70%` of websites (webservers) run on a Unix-based system. For us, this means we can significantly benefit from continuing to grow our knowledge of Unix/Linux and how we can gain shell sessions on these environments to potentially pivot further within an environment. While it is common for organizations to use 3rd parties & cloud providers to host their websites & web apps, many organizations still host their websites & web applications on servers in their network environments (on-prem). In these cases, we would want to establish a shell session with the underlying system to attempt to pivot to other systems on the internal network.
