# Blacklist Filters

In the previous section, we saw an example of a web application that only applied type validation controls on the front-end (i.e., client-side), which made it trivial to bypass these controls. This is why it is always recommended to implement all security-related controls on the back-end server, where attackers cannot directly manipulate it.

Still, if the type validation controls on the back-end server were not securely coded, an attacker can utilize multiple techniques to bypass them and reach PHP file uploads.

The exercise we find in this section is similar to the one we saw in the previous section, but it has a blacklist of disallowed extensions to prevent uploading web scripts. We will see why using a blacklist of common extensions may not be enough to prevent arbitrary file uploads and discuss several methods to bypass it.
