# Limited File Uploads

So far, we have been mainly dealing with filter bypasses to obtain arbitrary file uploads through a vulnerable web application, which is the main focus of this module at this level. While file upload forms with weak filters can be exploited to upload arbitrary files, some upload forms have secure filters that may not be exploitable with the techniques we discussed. However, even if we are dealing with a limited (i.e., non-arbitrary) file upload form, which only allows us to upload specific file types, we may still be able to perform some attacks on the web application.

Certain file types, like `SVG`, `HTML`, `XML`, and even some image and document files, may allow us to introduce new vulnerabilities to the web application by uploading malicious versions of these files. This is why fuzzing allowed file extensions is an important exercise for any file upload attack. It enables us to explore what attacks may be achievable on the web server. So, let's explore some of these attacks.
