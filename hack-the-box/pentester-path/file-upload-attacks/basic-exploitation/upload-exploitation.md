# Upload Exploitation

The final step in exploiting this web application is to upload the malicious script in the same language as the web application, like a web shell or a reverse shell script. Once we upload our malicious script and visit its link, we should be able to interact with it to take control over the back-end server.

## Web Shells

We can find many excellent web shells online that provide useful features, like directory traversal or file transfer. One good option for `PHP` is [phpbash](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash), which provides a terminal-like, semi-interactive web shell. Furthermore, [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Web-Shells) provides a plethora of web shells for different frameworks and languages, which can be found in the `/opt/useful/seclists/Web-Shells` directory in `PwnBox`.

We can download any of these web shells for the language of our web application (`PHP` in our case), then upload it through the vulnerable upload feature, and visit the uploaded file to interact with the web shell. For example, let's try to upload `phpbash.php` from [phpbash](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash) to our web application, and then navigate to its link by clicking on the Download button:
