# Log Poisoning

We have seen in previous sections that if we include any file that contains PHP code, it will get executed, as long as the vulnerable function has the `Execute` privileges. The attacks we will discuss in this section all rely on the same concept: Writing PHP code in a field we control that gets logged into a log file (i.e. `poison`/`contaminate` the log file), and then include that log file to execute the PHP code. For this attack to work, the PHP web application should have read privileges over the logged files, which vary from one server to another.

As was the case in the previous section, any of the following functions with `Execute` privileges should be vulnerable to these attacks:
