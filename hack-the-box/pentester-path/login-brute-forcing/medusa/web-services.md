In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, maintaining robust authentication mechanisms is paramount. While technologies like Secure Shell (`SSH`) and File Transfer Protocol (`FTP`) facilitate secure remote access and file management, they are often reliant on traditional username-password combinations, presenting potential vulnerabilities exploitable through brute-force attacks. In this module, we will delve into the practical application of `Medusa`, a potent brute-forcing tool, to systematically compromise both SSH and FTP services, thereby illustrating potential attack vectors and emphasizing the importance of fortified authentication practices.

`SSH` is a cryptographic network protocol that provides a secure channel for remote login, command execution, and file transfers over an unsecured network. Its strength lies in its encryption, which makes it significantly more secure than unencrypted protocols like `Telnet`. However, weak or easily guessable passwords can undermine SSH's security, exposing it to brute-force attacks.

`FTP` is a standard network protocol for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It's also widely used for uploading and downloading files from websites. However, standard FTP transmits data, including login credentials, in cleartext, rendering it susceptible to interception and brute-forcing.
