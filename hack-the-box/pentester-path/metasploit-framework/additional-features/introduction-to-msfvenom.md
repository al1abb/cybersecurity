# Introduction to MSFVenom

`MSFVenom` is the successor of `MSFPayload` and `MSFEncode`, two stand-alone scripts that used to work in conjunction with `msfconsole` to provide users with highly customizable and hard-to-detect payloads for their exploits.

`MSFVenom` is the result of the marriage between these two tools. Before this tool, we had to pipe (`|`) the result from `MSFPayload`, which was used to generate shellcode for a specific processor architecture and OS release, into `MSFEncode`, which contained multiple encoding schemes used both for removing bad characters from shellcode (this could sometimes cause instability during the runtime), and for evading older Anti-Virus (`AV`) and endpoint Intrusion Prevention / Intrusion Detection (`IPS/IDS`) software.

Nowadays, the two combined tools offer penetration testers a method to quickly craft payloads for different target host architectures and releases while having the possibility to 'clean up' their shellcode so that it does not run into any errors when deployed. The AV evasion part is much more complicated today, as signature-only-based analysis of malicious files is a thing of the past. `Heuristic analysis, machine learning, and deep packet inspection` make it much harder for a payload to run through several subsequent iterations of an encoding scheme to evade any good AV software. As seen in the `Payloads` module, submitting a simple payload with the same configuration detailed above yielded a hit rate of `52/65`. In terms of Malware Analysts worldwide, that is a Bingo. (It is still unproven that Malware Analysts worldwide actually say "that is a Bingo".)
