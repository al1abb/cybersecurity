# Databases

`Databases` in `msfconsole` are used to keep track of your results. It is no mystery that during even more complex machine assessments, much less entire networks, things can get a little fuzzy and complicated due to the sheer amount of search results, entry points, detected issues, discovered credentials, etc.

This is where Databases come into play. `Msfconsole` has built-in support for the PostgreSQL database system. With it, we have direct, quick, and easy access to scan results with the added ability to import and export results in conjunction with third-party tools. Database entries can also be used to configure Exploit module parameters with the already existing findings directly.

## Setting up the Database

First, we must ensure that the PostgreSQL server is up and running on our host machine. To do so, input the following command:

### **PostgreSQL Status**

```shell-session
$ sudo service postgresql status

● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Fri 2022-05-06 14:51:30 BST; 3min 51s ago
    Process: 2147 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 2147 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 1ms

May 06 14:51:30 pwnbox-base systemd[1]: Starting PostgreSQL RDBMS...
May 06 14:51:30 pwnbox-base systemd[1]: Finished PostgreSQL RDBMS.
```

### **Start PostgreSQL**

```shell-session
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

After starting PostgreSQL, we need to create and initialize the MSF database with `msfdb init`.

### **MSF - Initiate a Database**

```shell-session
$ sudo msfdb init

[i] Database already started
[+] Creating database user 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf_test'
[+] Creating configuration file '/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml'
[+] Creating initial database schema
rake aborted!
NoMethodError: undefined method `without' for #<Bundler::Settings:0x000055dddcf8cba8>
Did you mean? with_options

<SNIP>
```

Sometimes an error can occur if Metasploit is not up to date. This difference that causes the error can happen for several reasons.&#x20;

First, often it helps to update Metasploit again (`apt update`) to solve this problem. Then we can try to reinitialize the MSF database.

```shell-session
$ sudo msfdb init

[i] Database already started
[i] The database appears to be already configured, skipping initialization
```

If the initialization is skipped and Metasploit tells us that the database is already configured, we can recheck the status of the database.

```shell-session
$ sudo msfdb status

● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Mon 2022-05-09 15:19:57 BST; 35min ago
    Process: 2476 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 2476 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 1ms

[+] Detected configuration file (/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml)
```

If this error does not appear, which often happens after a fresh installation of Metasploit, then we will see the following when initializing the database:

```shell-session
$ sudo msfdb init

[+] Starting database
[+] Creating database user 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf_test'
[+] Creating configuration file '/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml'
[+] Creating initial database schema
```

### **MSF - Connect to the Initiated Database**

After the database has been initialized, we can start `msfconsole` and connect to the created database simultaneously.

```shell-session
$ sudo msfdb run

[i] Database already started

                                                                    .
                .
        o                  To boldly go where no
                            shell has gone before

msf6>
```

If, however, we already have the database configured and are not able to change the password to the MSF username, proceed with these commands:

### **MSF - Reinitiate the Database**

```shell-session
al1abb@htb[/htb]$ msfdb reinit
al1abb@htb[/htb]$ cp /usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml ~/.msf4/
al1abb@htb[/htb]$ sudo service postgresql restart
al1abb@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole -q

msf6 > db_status

[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: PostgreSQL.
```

Now, we are good to go. The `msfconsole` also offers integrated help for the database. This gives us a good overview of interacting with and using the database.

### **MSF - Database Options**

```shell-session
msf6 > help database

msf6 > db_status

[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
```

## Using the Database

With the help of the database, we can manage many different categories and hosts that we have analyzed. Alternatively, the information about them that we have interacted with using Metasploit. These databases can be exported and imported. This is especially useful when we have extensive lists of hosts, loot, notes, and stored vulnerabilities for these hosts. After confirming that the database is successfully connected, we can organize our `Workspaces`.

### **Workspaces**

We can think of `Workspaces` the same way we would think of folders in a project. We can segregate the different scan results, hosts, and extracted information by IP, subnet, network, or domain.

To view the current Workspace list, use the `workspace` command.&#x20;

Adding a `-a` or `-d` switch after the command, followed by the workspace's name, will either `add` or `delete` that workspace to the database.

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace

* default
```

Notice that the default Workspace is named `default` and is currently in use according to the `*` symbol. Type the `workspace [name]` command to switch the presently used workspace. Looking back at our example, let us create a workspace for this assessment and select it.

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace -a Target_1

[*] Added workspace: Target_1
[*] Workspace: Target_1


msf6 > workspace Target_1 

[*] Workspace: Target_1


msf6 > workspace

  default
* Target_1
```

To see what else we can do with Workspaces, we can use the `workspace -h` command for the help menu related to Workspaces.

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace -h

Usage:
    workspace                  List workspaces
    workspace -v               List workspaces verbosely
    workspace [name]           Switch workspace
    workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
    workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
    workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
    workspace -r     Rename workspace
    workspace -h               Show this help information
```

## Importing Scan Results

Next, let us assume we want to import a `Nmap scan` of a host into our Database's Workspace to understand the target better. We can use the `db_import` command for this. After the import is complete, we can check the presence of the host's information in our database by using the `hosts` and `services` commands. Note that the `.xml` file type is preferred for `db_import`.

### **Stored Nmap Scan**

```shell-session
$ cat Target.nmap
