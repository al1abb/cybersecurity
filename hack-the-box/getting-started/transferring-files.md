# Transferring Files

You can use wget or curl.

OR

## Using SCP

```bash
scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh
```

## Using Base64

In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file. For example, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine.&#x20;

In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) encode the file into `base64` format, and then we can paste the `base64` string on the remote server and decode it. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called `shell`, we can `base64` encode it as follows:

```bash
al1abb@htb[/htb]$ base64 shell -w 0

f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU
```

Now, we can copy this `base64` string, go to the remote host, and use `base64 -d` to decode it, and pipe the output into a file:

```bash
user@remotehost$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
```
