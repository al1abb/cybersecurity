# Kerberos, DNS, LDAP, MSRPC

While Windows operating systems use a variety of protocols to communicate, Active Directory specifically requires [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol), Microsoft's version of [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_\(protocol\)), [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) for authentication and communication, and [MSRPC](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/MSRPC) which is the Microsoft implementation of [Remote Procedure Call (RPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), an interprocess communication technique used for client-server model-based applications.

## Kerberos

Kerberos has been the default authentication protocol for domain accounts since Windows 2000. Kerberos is an open standard and allows for interoperability with other systems using the same standard. When a user logs into their PC, Kerberos is used to authenticate them via mutual authentication, or both the user and the server verify their identity. Kerberos is a stateless authentication protocol based on tickets instead of transmitting user passwords over the network. As part of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Domain Controllers have a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) that issues tickets. When a user initiates a login request to a system, the client they are using to authenticate requests a ticket from the KDC, encrypting the request with the user's password. If the KDC can decrypt the request (AS-REQ) using their password, it will create a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and transmit it to the user. The user then presents its TGT to a Domain Controller to request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket, encrypted with the associated service's NTLM password hash. Finally, the client requests access to the required service by presenting the TGS to the application or service, which decrypts it with its password hash. If the entire process completes appropriately, the user will be permitted to access the requested service or application.

Kerberos authentication effectively decouples users' credentials from their requests to consumable resources, ensuring that their password isn't transmitted over the network (i.e., accessing an internal SharePoint intranet site). The Kerberos Key Distribution Centre (KDC) does not record previous transactions. Instead, the Kerberos Ticket Granting Service ticket (TGS) relies on a valid Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). It assumes that if the user has a valid TGT, they must have proven their identity. The following diagram walks through this process at a high level.

| 1. When a user logs in, their password is used to encrypt a timestamp, which is sent to the Key Distribution Center (KDC) to verify the integrity of the authentication by decrypting it. The KDC then issues a Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT), encrypting it with the secret key of the krbtgt account. This TGT is used to request service tickets for accessing network resources, allowing authentication without repeatedly transmitting the user's credentials. This process decouples the user's credentials from requests to resources. |
| 2. The KDC service on the DC checks the authentication service request (AS-REQ), verifies the user information, and creates a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which is delivered to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3. The user presents the TGT to the DC, requesting a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket for a specific service. This is the TGS-REQ. If the TGT is successfully validated, its data is copied to create a TGS ticket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4. The TGS is encrypted with the NTLM password hash of the service or computer account in whose context the service instance is running and is delivered to the user in the TGS\_REP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5. The user presents the TGS to the service, and if it is valid, the user is permitted to connect to the resource (AP\_REQ).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The Kerberos protocol uses port 88 (both TCP and UDP). When enumerating an Active Directory environment, we can often locate Domain Controllers by performing port scans looking for open port 88 using a tool such as Nmap.

## DNS

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) uses DNS to allow clients (workstations, servers, and other systems that communicate with the domain) to locate Domain Controllers and for Domain Controllers that host the directory service to communicate amongst themselves. DNS is used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses and is broadly used across internal networks and the internet. Private internal networks use Active Directory DNS namespaces to facilitate communications between servers, clients, and peers. AD maintains a database of services running on the network in the form of service records (SRV). These service records allow clients in an AD environment to locate services that they need, such as a file server, printer, or Domain Controller. Dynamic DNS is used to make changes in the DNS database automatically should a system's IP address change. Making these entries manually would be very time-consuming and leave room for error. If the DNS database does not have the correct IP address for a host, clients will not be able to locate and communicate with it on the network. When a client joins the network, it locates the Domain Controller by sending a query to the DNS service, retrieving an SRV record from the DNS database, and transmitting the Domain Controller's hostname to the client. The client then uses this hostname to obtain the IP address of the Domain Controller. DNS uses TCP and UDP port 53. UDP port 53 is the default, but it falls back to TCP when no longer able to communicate and DNS messages are larger than 512 bytes.

### **Forward DNS Lookup**

Let's look at an example. We can perform a `nslookup` for the domain name and retrieve all Domain Controllers' IP addresses in a domain.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> nslookup INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

Server:  172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

### **Reverse DNS Lookup**

If we would like to obtain the DNS name of a single host using the IP address, we can do this as follows:

```powershell
PS C:\htb> nslookup 172.16.6.5

Server:  172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

### **Finding IP Address of a Host**

If we would like to find the IP address of a single host, we can do this in reverse. We can do this with or without specifying the FQDN.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> nslookup ACADEMY-EA-DC01

Server:   172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```
