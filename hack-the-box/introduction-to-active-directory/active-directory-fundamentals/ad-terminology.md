# AD Terminology

Before we go any further, let's take a step back and define some key terminology that will be used throughout this module and in general when dealing with Active Directory in any capacity.

### **Object**

An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers, etc.

### **Attributes**

Every object in Active Directory has an associated set of [attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/attributes-all) used to define characteristics of the given object. A computer object contains attributes such as the hostname and DNS name. All attributes in AD have an associated LDAP name that can be used when performing LDAP queries, such as `displayName` for `Full Name` and `given name` for `First Name`.

### **Schema**

The Active Directory [schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/schema) is essentially the blueprint of any enterprise environment. It defines what types of objects can exist in the AD database and their associated attributes. It lists definitions corresponding to AD objects and holds information about each object. For example, users in AD belong to the class "user," and computer objects to "computer," and so on. Each object has its own information (some required to be set and others optional) that are stored in Attributes. When an object is created from a class, this is called instantiation, and an object created from a specific class is called an instance of that class. For example, if we take the computer RDS01. This computer object is an instance of the "computer" class in Active Directory.

### **Domain**

A domain is a logical group of objects such as computers, users, OUs, groups, etc. We can think of each domain as a different city within a state or country. Domains can operate entirely independently of one another or be connected via trust relationships.

### **Forest**

A forest is a collection of Active Directory domains. It is the topmost container and contains all of the AD objects introduced below, including but not limited to domains, users, groups, computers, and Group Policy objects. A forest can contain one or multiple domains and be thought of as a state in the US or a country within the EU. Each forest operates independently but may have various trust relationships with other forests.

### **Tree**

A tree is a collection of Active Directory domains that begins at a single root domain. A forest is a collection of AD trees. Each domain in a tree shares a boundary with the other domains. A parent-child trust relationship is formed when a domain is added under another domain in a tree. Two trees in the same forest cannot share a name (namespace). Let's say we have two trees in an AD forest: `inlanefreight.local` and `ilfreight.local`. A child domain of the first would be `corp.inlanefreight.local` while a child domain of the second could be `corp.ilfreight.local`. All domains in a tree share a standard Global Catalog which contains all information about objects that belong to the tree.

### **Container**

Container objects hold other objects and have a defined place in the directory subtree hierarchy.

### **Leaf**

Leaf objects do not contain other objects and are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy.

### **Global Unique Identifier (GUID)**

A [GUID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-objectguid) is a unique 128-bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created. This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID, not only user and group objects. The GUID is stored in the `ObjectGUID` attribute. When querying for an AD object (such as a user, group, computer, domain, domain controller, etc.), we can query for its `objectGUID` value using PowerShell or search for it by specifying its distinguished name, GUID, SID, or SAM account name. GUIDs are used by AD to identify objects internally. Searching in Active Directory by GUID value is probably the most accurate and reliable way to find the exact object you are looking for, especially if the global catalog may contain similar matches for an object name. Specifying the `ObjectGUID` value when performing AD enumeration will ensure that we get the most accurate results pertaining to the object we are searching for information about. The `ObjectGUID` property `never` changes and is associated with the object for as long as that object exists in the domain.

### **Security principals**

[Security principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals) are anything that the operating system can authenticate, including users, computer accounts, or even threads/processes that run in the context of a user or computer account (i.e., an application such as Tomcat running in the context of a service account within the domain). In AD, security principles are domain objects that can manage access to other resources within the domain. We can also have local user accounts and security groups used to control access to resources on only that specific computer. These are not managed by AD but rather by the [Security Accounts Manager (SAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager).

### **Security Identifier (SID)**

A [security identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals), or SID is used as a unique identifier for a security principal or security group. Every account, group, or process has its own unique SID, which, in an AD environment, is issued by the domain controller and stored in a secure database. A SID can only be used once. Even if the security principle is deleted, it can never be used again in that environment to identify another user or group. When a user logs in, the system creates an access token for them which contains the user's SID, the rights they have been granted, and the SIDs for any groups that the user is a member of. This token is used to check rights whenever the user performs an action on the computer. There are also [well-known SIDs](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Well-known%20Security%20Identifiers) that are used to identify generic users and groups. These are the same across all operating systems. An example is the `Everyone` group.

### **Distinguished Name (DN)**

A [Distinguished Name (DN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/distinguished-names) describes the full path to an object in AD (such as `cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local`). In this example, the user `bjones` works in the IT department of the company Inlanefreight, and his account is created in an Organizational Unit (OU) that holds accounts for company employees. The Common Name (CN) `bjones` is just one way the user object could be searched for or accessed within the domain.

### **Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)**

A [Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/object-names-and-identities) is a single component of the Distinguished Name that identifies the object as unique from other objects at the current level in the naming hierarchy. In our example, `bjones` is the Relative Distinguished Name of the object. AD does not allow two objects with the same name under the same parent container, but there can be two objects with the same RDNs that are still unique in the domain because they have different DNs. For example, the object `cn=bjones,dc=dev,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local` would be recognized as different from `cn=bjones,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local`.

### **sAMAccountName**

The [sAMAccountName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/naming-properties#samaccountname) is the user's logon name. Here it would just be `bjones`. It must be a unique value and 20 or fewer characters.

### **userPrincipalName**

The [userPrincipalName](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/52250.active-directory-user-principal-name.aspx) attribute is another way to identify users in AD. This attribute consists of a prefix (the user account name) and a suffix (the domain name) in the format of `bjones@inlanefreight.local`. This attribute is not mandatory.

### **FSMO Roles**

In the early days of AD, if you had multiple DCs in an environment, they would fight over which DC gets to make changes, and sometimes changes would not be made properly. Microsoft then implemented "last writer wins," which could introduce its own problems if the last change breaks things. They then introduced a model in which a single "master" DC could apply changes to the domain while the others merely fulfilled authentication requests. This was a flawed design because if the master DC went down, no changes could be made to the environment until it was restored. To resolve this single point of failure model, Microsoft separated the various responsibilities that a DC can have into [Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/fsmo-roles) roles. These give Domain Controllers (DC) the ability to continue authenticating users and granting permissions without interruption (authorization and authentication). There are five FSMO roles: `Schema Master` and `Domain Naming Master` (one of each per forest), `Relative ID (RID) Master` (one per domain), `Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator` (one per domain), and `Infrastructure Master` (one per domain). All five roles are assigned to the first DC in the forest root domain in a new AD forest. Each time a new domain is added to a forest, only the RID Master, PDC Emulator, and Infrastructure Master roles are assigned to the new domain. FSMO roles are typically set when domain controllers are created, but sysadmins can transfer these roles if needed. These roles help replication in AD to run smoothly and ensure that critical services are operating correctly. We will walk through each of these roles in detail later in this section.

### **Global Catalog**

A [global catalog (GC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/global-catalog) is a domain controller that stores copies of ALL objects in an Active Directory forest. The GC stores a full copy of all objects in the current domain and a partial copy of objects that belong to other domains in the forest. Standard domain controllers hold a complete replica of objects belonging to its domain but not those of different domains in the forest. The GC allows both users and applications to find information about any objects in ANY domain in the forest. GC is a feature that is enabled on a domain controller and performs the following functions:

* Authentication (provided authorization for all groups that a user account belongs to, which is included when an access token is generated)
* Object search (making the directory structure within a forest transparent, allowing a search to be carried out across all domains in a forest by providing just one attribute about an object.)

### **Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)**

A [Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/rodc-and-active-directory-schema) has a read-only Active Directory database. No AD account passwords are cached on an RODC (other than the RODC computer account & RODC KRBTGT passwords.) No changes are pushed out via an RODC's AD database, SYSVOL, or DNS. RODCs also include a read-only DNS server, allow for administrator role separation, reduce replication traffic in the environment, and prevent SYSVOL modifications from being replicated to other DCs.
