# Linux Remote Management Protocols

In the world of Linux distributions, there are many ways to manage the servers remotely. For example, let us imagine that we are in one of many locations and one of our employees who just went to a customer in another city needs our help because of an error that he cannot solve. Efficient troubleshooting will look difficult over a phone call in most cases, so it is beneficial if we know how to log onto the remote system to manage it.

These applications and services can be found on almost every server in the public network. It is time-saving since we do not have to be physically present at the server, and the working environment still looks the same. These protocols and applications for remote systems management are an exciting target for these reasons. If the configuration is incorrect, we, as penetration testers, can even quickly gain access to the remote system. Therefore, we should familiarize ourselves with the most important protocols, servers, and applications for this purpose.
