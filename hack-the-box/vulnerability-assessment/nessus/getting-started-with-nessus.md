# Getting Started with Nessus

## Downloading Nessus

To download Nessus, we can navigate to its [Download Page](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true) to download the correct Nessus binary for our system. We will be downloading the Debian package for `Ubuntu` for this walkthrough.

## Requesting Free License

Next, we can visit the [Activation Code Page](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/activation-code) to request a Nessus Activation Code, which is necessary to get the free version of Nessus:

## Installing Package

With both the binary and activation code in hand, we can now install the Nessus package:

```bash
[!bash!]$ dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb

Selecting previously unselected package nessus.

```

## Starting Nessus

Once we have Nessus installed, we can start the Nessus Service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
```

## Accessing Nessus

To access Nessus, we can navigate to `https://localhost:8834`. Once we arrive at the setup page, we should select `Nessus Essentials` for the free version, and then we can enter our activation code:

Once we enter our activation code, we can set up a user with a `secure` password for our Nessus account. Then, the plugins will begin to compile once this step is completed:

Finally, once the setup is complete, we can start creating scans, scan policies, plugin rules, and customizing settings. The `Settings` page has a wealth of options such as setting up a Proxy Server or SMTP server, standard account management options, and advanced settings to customize the user interface, scanning, logging, performance, and security options.
