# Nessus Scan

A new Nessus scan can be configured by clicking `New Scan`, and selecting a scan type. Scan templates fall into three categories: `Discovery`, `Vulnerabilities`, and `Compliance`.

## New Scan

Here we have options for a basic `Host Discovery` scan to identify live hosts/open ports or a variety of scan types such as the `Basic Network Scan`, `Advanced Scan`, `Malware Scan`, `Web Application Tests`, as well as scans targeted at specific CVEs and audit & compliance standards. A description of each scan type can be found [here](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/ScanAndPolicyTemplates.htm).
