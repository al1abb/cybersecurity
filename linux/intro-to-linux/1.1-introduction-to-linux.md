# 1.1 - Introduction to Linux

## 4 Major Characteristics of Linux

1. **Linux is a kernel.** Linux is a fully-networked 32/64-Bit Operating System, including core utilities
2. **Linux is open source**. The source code for the operating system as well as its core utilities are freely available
3. **Linux has distributions.** There are hundreds of Linux distributions available to choose from. There are distributions suited to every imaginable purpose
4. **Linux embraces the CLI**. Although some distributions have a typical desktop graphical user interface (GUI), the Linux community celebrates the command line interface (CLI) that relies primarily on keyboard input.

### Linux is a Kernel

• Linux means the kernel of the system, which is the central controller of everything that happens on the computer.&#x20;

• Linux is a combination of the **Linux kernel** and software called **GNU/Linux**, which defines the operating system.&#x20;

– The Linux kernel is the **core of the operating system** that communicates directly with the hardware.&#x20;

– GNU/Linux is the **free software** that provides open-source equivalents of many common UNIX commands.

## Short story of Linux

• Linux started in **1991** as a hobby project by **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish born computer scientist studying at the University of Helsinki.&#x20;

• The GNU Project was developed by **Richard Stallman in 1983**.&#x20;

• Linux programmers were able to incorporate the GNU tools to provide a complete operating system.

• The story of Linux begins with UNIX, an operating system developed at AT\&T Bell Labs in the 1970s, written in the C language.&#x20;

• Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds based on UNIX – Linus Torvalds created it from scratch with assistance from programmers around the world – It was first **posted on the internet in 1991**&#x20;

• **Linux 1.0** was released in **1994** and **Linux 2.2 in 1999**&#x20;

• Today Linux is used on more than **3 billion** devices&#x20;

• All the **top 500 supercomputers** are based on Linux (or Unix-like) system

## Linux and the GNU Project

• Linus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel – the core of the OS, inspired by the open source movement and the GNU project.&#x20;

• The GNU Project is a free software, mass collaboration project, announced on September 27, 1983, by Richard Stallman at MIT.&#x20;

– Goal: create a Unix compatible software system composed of entirely free software.&#x20;

– GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).

## Linux Architecture

• **Hardware:** CPU, memory units, block devices and network adapters&#x20;

• **Kernel:** The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and is doing most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management&#x20;

• **Core Utilities:** preinstalled software for different purpose including shell programs&#x20;

• **Application Program:** web browser, web servers and more

## Linux is Open-Source

• Historically, most software has been issued under a closed-source license.&#x20;

• This means that you get the right to use the executable program or machine code, but cannot see the source code.&#x20;

• The development of Linux closely parallels the **rise of open-source** software.&#x20;

• The open-source philosophy is that you have a **right to obtain the software source code** and to **modify it for your own use**.

• When programmers on the Internet can read, modify and redistribute the source code of a software, **it evolves**.&#x20;

• People adapt it and improve it by fixing bugs.&#x20;

• This can happen at a speed that, compared to conventional software development, seems astonishing

• Torvalds has placed the code under a license called **GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2)**.&#x20;

– The source code **must be made available to anyone** who asks and **anyone is allowed to make changes**&#x20;

– Changes to the source code **must be placed under the same license**&#x20;

– No one is allowed to **charge for the source code other than the cost of distributing**

## The Free Software Foundation (FSF)

• Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985 with the goal of promoting free software.&#x20;

– Note: The word "free" does not refer to the price, but to the freedom to share, study, and modify the underlying source code.&#x20;

• The FSF maintains GNU General Public Licenses (GNU) to ensure that **all future variants** and modifications of the original program **must have exactly the same freedom of use** as the original. This philosophy is called **copyleft**.

## The Open Source Initiative (OSI)

• The Open Source Initiative is more permissive in how they allow software to be redistributed

– BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) license state that you may redistribute the source, as long as you maintain copyright notices and don’t imply that the original creator endorses your version. “Do what you want with this software, just don’t say you wrote it”.&#x20;

– MIT License does not contain copyleft provisions.

## Creative Commons

An organization created to address the intentions behind open-source licenses for non- software entities

## Operating Systems and Linux Distributions

### What is an OS?

• Software that runs on a computing device and manages the hardware and software components that make up the system.&#x20;

• It also schedules programs to run and provides services to users or programs (i.e., print).

## Linux Distributions

• Unlike Microsoft and Apple, which create every version of their operating system under the same roof including the kernel, the GUI and other components, Linux systems are created these days by individuals or group of people.&#x20;

• Any individuals or group of people, can create their own type of Linux, so called Linux Distributions&#x20;

• There are slightly differences between the different Linux distros

• Most of the distros are totally free, but not all of them

• A distribution refers to the Linux kernel, tools, and suite of applications that come bundled together.&#x20;

• Take Linux and the GNU tools, add some user-facing applications like a web browser and an email client, and you have a full Linux system.&#x20;

• There are distributions suited to every imaginable purpose.&#x20;

• There are distributions that focus on running servers, desktops, or even industry-specific tools like electronics design or statistical computing.

• Different distros put their own GUI and a set of preinstalled software&#x20;

• Every Linux distro has a goal or philosophy acting as the prime motivation in its creation process.&#x20;

– **Debian** is built with the leading line of distribution of free software&#x20;

– **CentOS (From Red Hat)** is built especially for performance and stability&#x20;

– **Kali Linux** is created for security operations&#x20;

– Other Linux distros are created for media consumption, musicians and many more…

### Debian

• Community effort that promotes the use of open-source software&#x20;

• Invented its own package management system (apt) based on the .deb file format.&#x20;

• Ubuntu is its most popular derived distribution, which has variants for desktop, server, and applications. Ubuntu also offers an LTS version.&#x20;

• Linux Mint is a derivative of Ubuntu with various free versions, some have license restrictions.

### Red Hat

• Focuses on **server applications** like web and file serving.&#x20;

• Releases **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**, **a stable distribution** with long release and maintenance cycles.&#x20;

• Sponsors the **Fedora Project**, a personal desktop with latest software.&#x20;

• **CentOS is a free version of RHEL** software which does not offer support.&#x20;

• Scientific Linux is a specific use distribution based on Red Hat.

### SUSE

• Originally derived from **Slackware**, which is the oldest distribution still maintained&#x20;

• Like Red Hat Linux, it offers **a very stable** environment for its users and works well with almost all the best Linux desktop apps&#x20;

• openSUSE is a completely open, free version with multiple desktop packages

{% hint style="info" %}
RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) is considered a little more stable than SUSE
{% endhint %}

### Android

• Provides a platform for mobile users&#x20;

• Lacks traditional GNU/Linux packages to make it compatible with desktop&#x20;

• Powered by Google

### Kali Linux

• Based on **Debian**&#x20;

• Designed for **security operations**, like digital forensics and penetration testing.&#x20;

• Has a lot of security tools pre-packaged.&#x20;

• It is maintained and funded by **Offensive Security**.

### Other Linux Distros

## Comparing Distributions

• **Role**: Does it provide a desktop environment or is it a server? Does it have a graphical user interface (GUI) or only provides a command line interface (CLI)?&#x20;

• **Function**: Is there specific software it needs to run, or specific functions it needs to perform? Has it a specific target?&#x20;

• **Life Cycle**: What is the release cycle and what is the maintenance or life cycle? Long term support, fixed release, rolling release?&#x20;

• **Stability**: Is the distribution stable and suitable for production environments or is it an experimental release, i.e. in a beta state?

• **Compatibility**: The ability of later operating systems to be compatible with software made for earlier versions.&#x20;

• **Cost**: The distribution itself might be zero cost, but paying for support may be worthwhile depending on organizational needs and capabilities.&#x20;

• **Size**: What is the size of this distribution? This is very important for embedded systems&#x20;

• **Package manager**: What is the default package manager? (Deb, RPM, Pacman)
