# 1.1 - Introduction to Linux

## 4 Major Characteristics of Linux

1. **Linux is a kernel.** Linux is a fully-networked 32/64-Bit Operating System, including core utilities
2. **Linux is open source**. The source code for the operating system as well as its core utilities are freely available
3. **Linux has distributions.** There are hundreds of Linux distributions available to choose from. There are distributions suited to every imaginable purpose
4. **Linux embraces the CLI**. Although some distributions have a typical desktop graphical user interface (GUI), the Linux community celebrates the command line interface (CLI) that relies primarily on keyboard input.

### Linux is a Kernel

• Linux means the kernel of the system, which is the central controller of everything that happens on the computer.&#x20;

• Linux is a combination of software called GNU/Linux, which defines the operating system.&#x20;

– GNU is the free software that provides open-source equivalents of many common UNIX commands. – The Linux part of this combination is the Linux kernel, which is the core of the operating system.

## Short story of Linux

• Linux started in **1991** as a hobby project by **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish born computer scientist studying at the University of Helsinki.&#x20;

• The GNU Project was developed by **Richard Stallman in 1983**.&#x20;

• Linux programmers were able to incorporate the GNU tools to provide a complete operating system.

• The story of Linux begins with UNIX, an operating system developed at AT\&T Bell Labs in the 1970s, written in the C language.&#x20;

• Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds based on UNIX – Linus Torvalds created it from scratch with assistance from programmers around the world – It was first **posted on the internet in 1991**&#x20;

• **Linux 1.0** was released in **1994** and **Linux 2.2 in 1999**&#x20;

• Today Linux is used on more than **3 billion** devices&#x20;

• All the **top 500 supercomputers** are based on Linux (or Unix-like) system

## Linux and the GNU Project

• Linus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel – the core of the OS, inspired by the open source movement and the GNU project.&#x20;

• The GNU Project is a free software, mass collaboration project, announced on September 27, 1983, by Richard Stallman at MIT.&#x20;

– Goal: create a Unix compatible software system composed of entirely free software.&#x20;

– GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).
