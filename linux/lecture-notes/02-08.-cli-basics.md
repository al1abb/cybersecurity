## Aliases and Variables

`alias [variable]="command to do"`

{% hint style="info" %}
Aliases are stored in **.bashrc file** in home directory. It is a hidden file

`ls` command is an alias itself
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Session Variables

`a=5`

`a=/etc/apt`

Using Variables

`$a`

`$variable_name`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
For red teaming, variables can be used to quickly write wordlist path, instead of writing it all manually

`$wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`

`Use $wordlist` instead of `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Session variable can **overwrite** the alias in .bashrc

`ls=ls`

Using `$ls` now won't print the folders colorfully as specified in .bashrc file
{% endhint %}

## History

history - Shows history of command. (Up to 1000 commands)

{% hint style="info" %}
!! runs the second most recent command
{% endhint %}

### Clear history

`history -c` = Clears history (Might not work in Kali Linux)

Does not clean .bash\_history (Last exit actions are saved here). Remove .bash\_history too

{% hint style="info" %}
You need 2 things to remove all history: `history -c` and removing .bash\_history file
{% endhint %}

Delete a specific history command based on position:

`history -d 3` = Delete 3rd command in history.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't disable history but know that it can help with Privilege Escalation

What you can do, is to limit the amount of commands stored in history
{% endhint %}

## Commands

`command [options] [arguments]`

### Options

{% hint style="info" %}
**Double dash** options are usually going to be full words

Example: `ls --help` (there is no `ls -h`)

**Double dash** is most common!
{% endhint %}

### Arguments

`ls` = Default is `.`

`cd` = Default argument is `~` . `cd ~` = `cd`

`ls -l /etc/apt /etc/sudoers` = Lists files and folders in both folders (apt and sudoers)

## Linux Filesystem

Think of dev folder as firmware.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For red teaming, firmware based exploits go to dev folder
{% endhint %}

## Paths

Absolute Path = /home/al1abb

Relative Path (From current location) = home/al1abb

{% hint style="info" %}
`..` = Current Parent Directory
{% endhint %}

## ls -la

{% hint style="info" %}
To include year for last modification time, you can use --full-time

`ls -la --full-time`
{% endhint %}
