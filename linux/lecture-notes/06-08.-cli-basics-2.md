## Globbing (Pattern matching):

### Asterisk \*

`ls -d /etc/a*`

`ls -d` = lists dirs only, not their contents

{% hint style="info" %}
`cp * /some_dest` - Asterisk (\*) will not select hidden files

`cp * .* /some_dest` - Will match hidden files as well
{% endhint %}

### Question ?

{% hint style="info" %}
`ls -d /etc/???` - Returns all files/folders in etc that have three letters in their name
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Combined example (Globbing + Question)

`ls -d /etc/*.????`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
`echo /etc/*.123` (not existing file) - Will still echo = /etc/\*.123.

But with `echo /etc/*???` it will try pattern matching, and it will print the name of the files it found
{% endhint %}

### Brackets

echo /etc/\[abc]\*.???? = starting with a or b or c

Ranges:

\[0-9], \[a-i], \[a-zA-Z]

### Exclamation Point !

`echo /etc/[!a-t]*` - will display any file that does not begin with a letter between a-t. Does not work with kali

## Brace Expansion (Pattern creation)

{% hint style="info" %}
You have to use commas with pattern creating, no need with pattern matching
{% endhint %}

touch file\_{a,b,c} = creates 3 files (file\_a, file\_b, file\_c)

touch file\_{1..10} = creates 10 files

touch file\_{1..10..2} = creates files 1,3,5,7,9

{% hint style="info" %}
Dont use square brackets for pattern creation
{% endhint %}
