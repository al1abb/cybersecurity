# 23/07. VM networking + start modes

VMware does not have NAT from the image. It has NAT but it does the job of NAT Network from the image below:

Virtual Box has all from the above image. We will mostly use NAT Network and Bridged

Telnet = unsecure SSH (Running on port 23)

{% hint style="info" %}
SSH uses RSA key fingerprinting for auth. For the first time authentications. SSH has a list of known hosts

* If you answer yes at the prompt (asking to verify the machineâ€™s identity), the RSA key fingerprint of the remote machine will be stored on your local system

This secures you against ARP Spoofing.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
On a bridged network, first randomize MAC or problems regarding the ARP table will be there and the IP address from DHCP will be the same causing collisions
{% endhint %}

### Start modes
