# 09/08. Help methods, Concatenation, File descriptors

`whatis [tool](ex: ls)` - 1-line man. Exact same as `man -f`

`apropos [tool] (ex: git)` or `man -k` - See which tools work with given argument

{% hint style="info" %}
`--help` is more common for help menu
{% endhint %}

Depth of help methods (1-very easy, 3 is highly technical, actual documentation):

1\) --help

2\) man

3\) info

{% hint style="info" %}
In man, you can use `/` to search for a specific keyword. N to move to next reference, Shift+N to go back one word
{% endhint %}

Man pages are categorized. 1 is for user programs, 5 is for file formats

man for passwd file:

`man 5 passwd` - Gives us info about /etc/passwd file

Additional documentation can be found on `/usr/share/doc` and `/usr/doc`

## Concatenation (Chaining commands)

{% hint style="info" %}
Head and Tail

`head -n 5` - Show first 5 lines (default 10)

`tail -n 5` - Show last 5 lines (default 10)
{% endhint %}

### && Operator

Concatenates commands. Second command works if first one is successful

`echo "bob" && ls -a` - both work fine

`cat does_not_exist && ls -a` - does not work as does\_not\_exist was not found

### || (OR) Operator

**It returns true one.** This looks for failure. Described as backup command

**Executes next one only if the 1st one failed**

`ls -a && ls -dl /media` - Runs first command, but does not run 2nd as 1st was true

### ; Operator

Does not look for success or failure. Just runs the command.

**Chains commands regardless of success or failure**

### | (pipe) Operator

Enables us to give output of 1 command to next command

## Linux Streams (File Descriptors)

STDOUT = 1

STDERR = 2

STDIN = 0

Not every command (ls does not) will allow you to pass input

### Redirecting STDOUT

#### > (Overwrites)

`ls -l / > test.txt` (there is a hidden 1 here: `ls -l / 1> test.txt`)

#### >> (Appends)

`ls -l / >> test.txt`

### Redirecting STDERR

You cannot redirect error outputs using just STDOUT (>)

You have to change **1>** (default) to **2>**

`cat non_existing_file.txt 2> output.txt` - Content of output is the error message

### & (Redirecting Both)

`ls -la &> both.txt` - Logs both success and error to a single file

{% hint style="info" %}
If you combine 1> 2> with &>, it will not work. It ignores 1> and 2>
{% endhint %}
