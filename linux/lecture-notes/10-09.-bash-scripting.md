# 10/09. Bash Scripting

**Exam INFO:** More than half will be about grep

## Variables

Local and Environment variables

{% hint style="info" %}
Dont leave spaces in bash when creating variables
{% endhint %}

> linux="Kali"

> echo $linux
>
> Kali

`env` = check env variables

{% hint style="info" %}
CD command modifies PWD variable in env variables
{% endhint %}

When writing commands, it does not know where to find them. So it looks to path variable in env variables. And then searches in given folders for binary

`export` = convert local variable to env variable (Is valid until user logs out)

`unset` = opposite of export

{% hint style="info" %}
Local variables only exist in current shell. Environment variables are global, system-wide
{% endhint %}

$PATH = lists all the places that the system can look for programs to execute

### Command Substitution

echo `` `pwd` `` = puts the result of `pwd` inside a string after echo

More modern approach for this is:

echo $(pwd)

### read

> `read input1` = Read an input and assign it to input1 variable

> `echo $input1` = Whatever you put in inside input1 variable when using read command

### Special Variables

`$0` = name of the script itself

`$?` = checks exit code for the previous code (mostly 0,1,2)
