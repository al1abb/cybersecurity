# 16/08. Users and Groups. 20/08. User config, login.defs, groups, who command

## `id`

`id` - shows user group information. Combines info from passwd and group file

`id -G` = gives secondary group id numbers

{% hint style="info" %}
It is **not recommended** to modify passwd, or shadow files manually
{% endhint %}

You can check every users information (including root) using `id` command

etc/passwd and etc/group files are already readable

## /etc/passwd

7 parts

1\) kali = username

2\) x = shows that there is a password but it is in shadow file

3\) 1000 = user id

4\) 1000 = group id

5\) Some user comment = simple comment about user

6\) /home/kali = home directory

7\) /bin/bash = default shell

{% hint style="info" %}
Changing user id might be used in **privesc**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
/bin/false or .../nologin = you **cannot login** to that user. used in system users.&#x20;

If you try to ssh into any of the users with a shell like this, it will kick you out
{% endhint %}

## System Accounts

**Users** log in using regular accounts **(UID > 1000)**.

Special access root account **(UID = 0)**.

System accounts are designed for **services** running on the system **(UID 1-499)**

## 20/08.

## User configuration

Users group = 100

`useradd -D` = view or change some of the default values

GROUP=100&#x20;

GROUPS=&#x20;

HOME=/home&#x20;

INACTIVE=-1&#x20;

EXPIRE=&#x20;

SHELL=/bin/sh&#x20;

SKEL=/etc/skel&#x20;

USRSKEL=/usr/etc/skel&#x20;

CREATE\_MAIL\_SPOOL=no&#x20;

LOG\_INIT=yes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Skel file** is like a template directory where you store files you want replicated for every user when their accounts are created
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Root user can always read, write and execute every file. If file owner is root, the first rwx part does not matter
{% endhint %}

## /etc/login.defs

## who command

kali tty7 2024-08-19 18:22 (:0) = Physical Shell

kali pts/0 2024-08-19 18:22 (172.31.0.2) = ssh terminal (sudo terminal). it also specifies ip address you connected from + the time

`w` command gives additional updates (more than who)

What they are doing (+ for how long they have been doing it), login time, TTY or no?, User and more

## Groups

{% hint style="info" %}
in /etc/group file you never see primary group, you always see secondary groups.

Primary group is shown in passwd file
{% endhint %}

### getent

Can get info from passwd, group, shadow files

{% hint style="info" %}
└─$ getent group kali&#x20;

kali:x:1000:
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
└─$ getent passwd kali&#x20;

kali:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/kali:/usr/bin/zsh
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
└─$ sudo getent shadow kali&#x20;

\[sudo] password for kali:&#x20;

kali:$y$j9T$hRLNczNaMnWjaIlEM3Gu51$AX7a7GZxp59zDXxaYo7Wb8f9C7FSTNTMc552LkSYDz/:19870:0:99999:7:::
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Grep is better, but getent is also an option
{% endhint %}

There is only one group file. there might also be group- file which is backup

### Creating a group

`groupadd` = use by root user to create a new group

{% hint style="info" %}
This can only be done by root as /etc/group is only writeable by root
{% endhint %}

`groupadd -g [Group ID]` = specify group id (GID) when creating groups

GIDs under 1000 are for system use. To bypass this use `groupadd -r`

### Modifying a group

`groupmod` = change the name (`-n`) or the GID (`-g`) of the group

Name:

`groupmod -n clerks sales`

GID:

`groupmod -g 10003 clerks`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Changing the GID will cause files to no longer be associated with that group.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To search for orphaned files, use the find command with the `-nogroup` option.
{% endhint %}

### Deleting a group

`groupdel [group_name]` = delete a group

{% hint style="warning" %}
Files in the deleted group will become orphaned.
{% endhint %}

## Creating a user

`useradd` = better for scripting

`adduser` = has interactivity

`useradd` :&#x20;

`-g:` Primary group

`-G:` Secondary group(s)

`-m:` Create a home directory

`-s:` Shell of the user

`-u:` User ID to assign

## User password setting

`passwd [username]`

## Modifying and deletion of users

To delete a user without deleting the user’s home directory execute:

`userdel [username]`

To delete a user and their home directory execute:

`userdel -r [username]`

{% hint style="info" %}
When user gets deleted, in its files, you see UID of the user instead of the name
{% endhint %}
