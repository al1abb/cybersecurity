# 23/08. Ownership and Permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
When you remove a user that has files, those files show old user id when doing `ls -la`
{% endhint %}

## chown

`chown james:purple file` = Change permission of a file to a specific user+group

## newgrp

`newgrp` = Temporarily switch to different group. Used for creating a file under a different group

{% hint style="info" %}
The newgrp command opens a new shell; as long as the user stays in that shell, the primary group won't change.&#x20;

To switch the primary group back to the original, the user can leave the new shell by running the exit command.
{% endhint %}

## chgrp

`chgrp` = change the group owner of existing file

## Permission Types

r = list

w = add or remove (is useless on its own)

x = access or reference
