# 23/08. Ownership and Permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
When you remove a user that has files, those files show old user id when doing `ls -la`
{% endhint %}

## chown

`chown james:purple file` = Change permission of a file to a specific user+group

## newgrp

`newgrp` = Temporarily switch to different group. Used for creating a file under a different group

{% hint style="info" %}
The newgrp command opens a new shell; as long as the user stays in that shell, the primary group won't change.&#x20;

To switch the primary group back to the original, the user can leave the new shell by running the exit command.
{% endhint %}

## chgrp

`chgrp` = change the group owner of existing file

## Permission Types

r = list

w = add or remove (is useless on its own)

x = access or reference

## chmod (Change Mod)

### Symbolic method

u = user owner

g = group owner

o = others

a = all



\+ = add

\- = remove

\= equals



`chmod a+x file` = add execute permission to file in all (user, group, others)

`chmod o-r file` = remove read permission from others

`chmod o=file` = remove all permissions from others

## umask

{% hint style="info" %}
Maximum default values for files and directories

Files = 666

Directories = 777 (extra x permission for access)
{% endhint %}

umask = Tells you your current mask value

Subtract umask from the maximum

`umask` = Output is 002

666-002 = **664**

`umask 006` = Sets umask to 006

666-006=660 (rw-,rw-,---) (no permission for others)

This is temporary (for current session)

For something permanent, modify bashrc file

## Setuid Permissions

Red highlighted files are setuid permissions. rw**s**

s is different from S:

s has execute S does not.

With setuid, if executed, it will run as from its owner

s: Both owner and other permission groups (u,g,o) can execute (for u,g,o they can execute if u,g,o has x permissions)

S: owner cant execute, but if you have execute (r-x) enabled for you, you can execute

Adding SUID:

`chmod u+s file`

`chmod 4775 file`

## Setgid Permissions

rwx r-**s** r-x

`chmod g+s file`

`chmod 2775 file`

## Sticky bit Permission

Stops everyone from deleting files. Only root and you can delete your own files
