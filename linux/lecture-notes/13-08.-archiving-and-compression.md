# 13/08. Archiving and Compression

**Archiving** - combines multiple files into one

**Compression** - reduce file size by removing redundant information

A zip file can do both at the same time.

## Archiving

### tar (TApeaRchive)

Unix utility to archive files

has 3 modes:

Create (c), Extract(x), List (t)

\-f: what file are you creating or extracting from. Should come at the end of the options (flags), before the file name

\-v: verbose

## Compression

2 types: Lossless(no info removed from the file), Lossy (Image, audio,video)

gzip and bzip2 are used algorithms in Linux

### gzip

gzip does it directly to a file by default, so you will lose your actual file and it will turn into a .gz

`gzip [filename]` (only can be used against a single file)

Decompress: `gunzip [filename]` or `gzip -d`

{% hint style="info" %}
Tar can be used for archiving + compression

`tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz file*` (-z for gzip) (-j for bzip2)

bz - Efficient ratio but probably takes longer

gz - faster
{% endhint %}

### zip

`zip [archive_name] [files]`

zip does all in one go.
