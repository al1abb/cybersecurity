# 13/08. Archiving and Compression

**Archiving** - combines multiple files into one

**Compression** - reduce file size by removing redundant information

A zip file can do both at the same time.

## Archiving

### tar (TApeaRchive)

Unix utility to archive files

has 3 modes:

Create (c), Extract(x), List (t)

\-f: what file are you creating or extracting from. Should come at the end of the options (flags), before the file name

\-v: verbose

## Compression

2 types: Lossless(no info removed from the file), Lossy (Image, audio,video)

gzip and bzip2 are used algorithms in Linux
