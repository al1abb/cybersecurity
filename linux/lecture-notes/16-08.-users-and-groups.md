# 16/08. Users and Groups

## `id`

`id` - shows user group information. Combines info from passwd and group file

`id -G` = gives secondary group id numbers

{% hint style="info" %}
It is **not recommended** to modify passwd, or shadow files manually
{% endhint %}

You can check every users information (including root) using `id` command

etc/passwd and etc/group files are already readable

## /etc/passwd

7 parts

1\) kali = username

2\) x = shows that there is a password but it is in shadow file

3\) 1000 = user id

4\) 1000 = group id

5\) Some user comment = simple comment about user

6\) /home/kali = home directory

7\) /bin/bash = default shell

{% hint style="info" %}
Changing user id might be used in **privesc**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
/bin/false or .../nologin = you **cannot login** to that user. used in system users.&#x20;

If you try to ssh into any of the users with a shell like this, it will kick you out
{% endhint %}

## System Accounts

**Users** log in using regular accounts **(UID > 1000)**.

Special access root account **(UID = 0)**.

System accounts are designed for **services** running on the system **(UID 1-499)**
