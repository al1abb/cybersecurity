# 27/08. Sudo

`sudo -l`

(ALL : ALL) ALL = You can run everything as all users and as all groups (including root)

`sudo -u bob` = Run command as bob user

`sudo -u` = Run command as root

## Sudoers file

`sudo visudo` = command that is used to modify entries in sudoers file.&#x20;

Only root user can modify this file.&#x20;

By default this file has only read permissions

{% hint style="warning" %}
`sudo nano /etc/sudoers` - using this command to modify sudoers is **not recommended**
{% endhint %}

### User privilege specification

root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

{% hint style="info" %}
No % sign in front means that it is a user
{% endhint %}

### Group privilege specification

Allow members of group sudo to execute any command

%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

### Sudoers Structure

`bob ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`

o **bob** – The user to which the entry applies.&#x20;

o **ALL** – The hostname to which it applies.&#x20;

o **(ALL:ALL)** – Under which name and group the command can be executed.&#x20;

o **ALL** – The actual command that can be executed.



`james ALL=(red-1) /bin/cat /home/red-1/.secret, /tmp/red_binary`

Whatever james user will try to execute with sudo, it will only run it as that user (red-1)



{% hint style="danger" %}
Wildcard in sudoers file is **very dangerous!**

`red-3 ALL=(ALL) /bin/cat /home/blue-1/*`

This means you go do path traversal and can go back
{% endhint %}
