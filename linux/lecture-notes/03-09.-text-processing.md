## grep

`grep <options> <pattern> <file or files>`

Options

`-i, --ignore-case` = Ignore character case (accept both lowercase and uppercase)

`-v, --invert-match` = Invert match, anything other than. Anti Grep

Example with extended grep:

`grep -vE '/nologin|/false|/sync' /etc/passwd` = don't show users that have nologin, false, or sync as shells

`-A <num>` = show x lines after found element

`-B <num>` = show x lines before found element

`-C <num>` = combination of A and B. show x lines before + after found text

`-r` = recursive grep in files

Recursive grep example: `grep -r 'kali' /etc/` = show kali text match in every file in /etc

`-h, --no-filenames` = remove filenames (ex: from recursive grep)

`-o` = show only nonempty parts of lines that match

`-l, --files-with-matches` = show me file names with matches

`-L, --files-without-match` = show me file names without matches

## cut

`-d` = delimiter, how you want it to be separated

`-f <field_num>` = column to select

`cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ':' -f 1` = separate elements by ":" sign. And then select based on `-f` flag

## sort

**Sorts alphabetically by default**

If you have multiple fields cut using `cut` command, and you want to sort based on a diff column you use:

`sort -n -t ':' -k 2`

`-n` = numerical sort

`-t` = delimiter

`-k` = column to select
