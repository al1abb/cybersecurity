# 03/09. Text Processing

{% hint style="info" %}
`more` is more common in Linux distros. `less` is less common
{% endhint %}

## grep

`grep <options> <pattern> <file or files>`

Options

`-i, --ignore-case` = Ignore character case (accept both lowercase and uppercase)

`-v, --invert-match` = Invert match, anything other than. Anti Grep

Example with extended grep:

`grep -vE '/nologin|/false|/sync' /etc/passwd` = don't show users that have nologin, false, or sync as shells

`-A <num>` = show x lines after found element

`-B <num>` = show x lines before found element

`-C <num>` = combination of A and B. show x lines before + after found text

`-r` = recursive grep in files

Recursive grep example: `grep -r 'kali' /etc/` = show kali text match in every file in /etc

`-h, --no-filenames` = remove filenames (ex: from recursive grep)

`-o` = show matches only, not full line. line by line

`-c` = **count the number of matching lines** rather than displaying the matching lines themselves

`-l, --files-with-matches` = show me file names with matches

`-L, --files-without-match` = show me file names without matches

## cut

`-d` = delimiter, how you want it to be separated

`-f <field_num>` = column to select

`cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ':' -f 1` = separate elements by ":" sign. And then select based on `-f` flag

## sort

**Sorts alphabetically by default**

If you have multiple fields cut using `cut` command, and you want to sort based on a diff column you use:

`sort -n -t ':' -k 2`

`-n` = numerical sort

`-t` = delimiter

`-k` = column to select

`-r` = reverse sort

`-u` = sort and remove duplicates

## uniq

`-c` = show count of duplicates

Example: `grep -rioh 'kali' /etc/ 2> /dev/null | sort | uniq -c` :

```
143 kali
 42 Kali
 11 KALI
```

{% hint style="info" %}
sort -u **does not show** count of duplicates,

uniq -c **shows** count of duplicates
{% endhint %}

## tr

**Does not** have string substitution

`cat /etc/passwd | tr "a-z" "A-Z"`

Does it letter by letter

## sed

example 1:

`echo 'windows is the best' | sed 's/windows/linux/'`

linux is the best

example 2:

Put g (global) at the end:

`echo 'windows is the best windows' | sed 's/windows/linux/g'`

linux is the best linux

{% hint style="info" %}
Without /g, it only does it one time (for the first)
{% endhint %}

## wc

Word count is dumb

`-l` = shows number of lines

`-w` = shows number of words

`-c` = number of bytes, characters

wc itself shows l,w,c by default (remember: 1,1,42)&#x20;
