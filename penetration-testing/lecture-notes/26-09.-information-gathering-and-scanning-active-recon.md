# 26/09. Information Gathering and Scanning, Active Recon, fping, Nmap

**fping** - a tool used to perform ping sweeps

* \-g = range
* \-a = show only alive hosts
* \-q = no errors

`fping -a -q -g 192.168.168.1/24 > live_hosts`

## Nmap

nmap

* \-sL = Lists the targets to scan and does a reverse-DNS lookup
* \-sn = no scan, just live host discovery
* \-Pn = No ping, just scanning
* \-F = Scans **top 100** ports (not 0-100, but most common ports)
* \-PS/-PA/-PU/-PY \[portlist] = TCP SYN/ACK, UDP, or SCTP discovery to given ports
* \-n = No DNS Resolution
* \-v = Verbose (Use for learning)
* \-oN/ -oX/ -oG \<file> = Outputs scan in Normal, XML (for pentest.ws), and grepable formats
  * nmap 192.168.168.1/24 -oA 168.1\_24\_tcp (James uses this naming convention)
* \-O = OS fingerprinting

Use **scanme.nmap.org** to test nmap scans

Nmap scans TCP by default. But you should run UDP scans too!

TCP Connect (Stealth) Scan is not very stealthy as modern devices log everything. But it is slightly quicker

### Scan Types:

* \-sT = TCP Connect Scan
* \-sS = SYN Scan
* \-sV = performs a version detection scan
