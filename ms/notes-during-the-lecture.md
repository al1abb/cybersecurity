# Notes during the lecture

Default Gateway is usually IP .1(first) or IP .254(last) in big companies (Houses have 1)

DNS - Translates names to IP Addresses

www.domain.com

www - is standardized here. (Computer name)

DNS Zones:

1. Forward (Name => IP)
2. Reverse (IP => Name)
3. There is also Name => Name. (For example when companies change names). Kind of like alias
