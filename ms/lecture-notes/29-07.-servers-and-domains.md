# 29/07. Servers and Domains

There are more Linux based webservers than microsoft based ones.

Active Directory is also a DNS. Its completely dependent on DNS

Normal users dont use Windows Server

Our computers in AKM are like workgroup computers

In domain comps execute something evenly (in common) (under someone's domain)

Subdomains are like a folder under the main domain (like a subdivision)
