In many things where you use IP, it will go with legacy products and software. Using IP is advantage for red team, disadvantage for blue. Name is better for blue

Everything you do in Windows (even something small like changing file order in a folder) has a place where this change is logged to and stored in.&#x20;

For folder its inside the folder itself

## Windows Naming Systems

### NetBIOS

• NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT-NS) is a name resolution protocol that allows computers to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses. It is enabled by default on Windows operating systems, and it uses broadcast method for name resolution.&#x20;

• It is a session layer protocol in the OSI model and provides services such as naming, datagram, and session services to applications on the network.&#x20;

• One of the main features of NetBIOS is its ability to provide a name resolution service, which allows devices on a network to resolve friendly names to IP addresses and vice versa.

WINS = Windows naming service

### DNS
